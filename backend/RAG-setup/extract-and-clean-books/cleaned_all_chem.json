This will be followed by\nstudying the properties of the solutions, like vapour\npressure and colligative properties. We will begin with\ntypes of solutions and then various alternatives in\nwhich concentrations of a solute can be expressed in\nliquid solution.\n11111.....11111 TTTTTyyyyypppppeeeeesssss ooooofffff Solutions are homogeneous mixtures of two or more than two\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss components. By homogenous mixture we mean that its composition\nand properties are uniform throughout the mixture. Generally, the\ncomponent that is present in the largest quantity is known as solvent.\nSolvent determines the physical state in which solution exists. One or\nmore components present in the solution other than solvent are called\nsolutes. In this Unit we shall consider only binary solutions (i.e.,\nReprint 2025-26\nconsisting of two components). Here each component may be\nsolid, liquid or in gaseous state and are summarised in Table 1.1.\nTable 1.1: Types of Solutions\nType of Solution Solute Solvent Common Examples\nGaseous Solutions Gas Gas Mixture of oxygen and nitrogen gases\nLiquid Gas Chloroform mixed with nitrogen gas\nSolid Gas Camphor in nitrogen gas\nLiquid Solutions Gas Liquid Oxygen dissolved in water\nLiquid Liquid Ethanol dissolved in water\nSolid Liquid Glucose dissolved in water\nSolid Solutions Gas Solid Solution of hydrogen in palladium\nLiquid Solid Amalgam of mercury with sodium\nSolid Solid Copper dissolved in gold\nComposition of a solution can be described by expressing its\n11111.....22222 EEEEExxxxxppppprrrrreeeeessssssssssiiiiinnnnnggggg\nconcentration. The latter can be expressed either qualitatively\nCCCCCooooonnnnnccccceeeeennnnntttttrrrrraaaaatttttiiiiiooooonnnnn or quantitatively. For example, qualitatively we can say that the\nooooofffff SSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss solution is dilute (i.e., relatively very small quantity of solute)\nor it is concentrated (i.e., relatively very large quantity of\nsolute). But in real life these kinds of description can add to\nlot of confusion and thus the need for a quantitative description\nof the solution.\nThere are several ways by which we can describe the concentration\nof the solution quantitatively.\n(i) Mass percentage (w/w): The mass percentage of a component of a\nsolution is defined as:\nMass % of a component\nMass of the component in the solution\n= 100 (1.1)\nTotal mass of the solution\nFor example, if a solution is described by 10% glucose in water by\nmass, it means that 10g of glucose is dissolved in 90 g of water\nresulting in a 100 g solution. Concentration described by mass\npercentage is commonly used in industrial chemical applications.\nFor example, commercial bleaching solution contains 3.62 mass\npercentage of sodium hypochlorite in water.\n(ii) Volume percentage (V/V): The volume percentage is defined as:\nVolume of the component\nVolume % of a component = 100\nTotal volume of solution\n(1.2)\nChemistry 2\nReprint 2025-26\nFor example, 10% ethanol solution in water means that 10 mL\nof ethanol is dissolved in water such that the total volume of\nthe solution is 100 mL. Solutions containing liquids are commonly\nexpressed in this unit. For example, a 35% (v/v) solution of\nethylene glycol, an antifreeze, is used in cars for cooling the\nengine. At this concentration the antifreeze lowers the freezing\npoint of water to 255.4K (–17.6°C).\n(iii) Mass by volume percentage (w/V): Another unit which is\ncommonly used in medicine and pharmacy is mass by\nvolume percentage. It is the mass of solute dissolved in\n100 mL of the solution.\n(iv) Parts per million: When a solute is present in trace quantities, it\nis convenient to express concentration in parts per million (ppm)\nand is defined as:\nParts per million =\nNumberof parts of the component\n×106 (1.3)\nTotal number of parts of all components of the solution\nAs in the case of percentage, concentration in parts per million can\nalso be expressed as mass to mass, volume to volume and mass to\nvolume. A litre of sea water (which weighs 1030 g) contains about\n6 × 10–3 g of dissolved oxygen (O ). Such a small concentration is\n2\nalso expressed as 5.8 g per 106 g (5.8 ppm) of sea water. The\nconcentration of pollutants in water or atmosphere is often expressed\nin terms of mg mL–1 or ppm.\n(v) Mole fraction: Commonly used symbol for mole fraction is x and\nsubscript used on the right hand side of x denotes the component.\nIt is defined as:\nMole fraction of a component =\nNumber of moles of the component\n(1.4)\nTotal number of moles of all the components\nFor example, in a binary mixture, if the number of moles of A and B are\nn and n respectively, the mole fraction of A will be\nA B\nn\nx = A (1.5)\nA n  n\nA B\nFor a solution containing i number of components, we have:\nn n\nx = i = i (1.6)\ni n  n .......n n\n1 2 i i\nIt can be shown that in a given solution sum of all the mole\nfractions is unity, i.e.\nx + x + .................. + x = 1 (1.7)\n1 2 i\nMole fraction unit is very useful in relating some physical properties\nof solutions, say vapour pressure with the concentration of the\nsolution and quite useful in describing the calculations involving\ngas mixtures.\n3 Solutions\nReprint 2025-26\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 11111.....11111 Calculate the mole fraction of ethylene glycol (C H O ) in a solution\n2 6 2\ncontaining 20% of C H O by mass.\n2 6 2\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn Assume that we have 100 g of solution (one can start with any amount of\nsolution because the results obtained will be the same).

Mass %, ppm, mole fraction and molality\nare independent of temperature, whereas molarity is a function of\ntemperature. This is because volume depends on temperature\nand the mass does not.\nCalculate molality of 2.5 g of ethanoic acid (CH COOH) in 75 g of benzene.

It depends\nupon the nature of solute and solvent as well as temperature and\npressure. Let us consider the effect of these factors in solution of a solid\nor a gas in a liquid.\n5 Solutions\nReprint 2025-26\n1.3.1 Solubility of Every solid does not dissolve in a given liquid. While sodium chloride\na Solid in a and sugar dissolve readily in water, naphthalene and anthracene do\nLiquid not. On the other hand, naphthalene and anthracene dissolve readily in\nbenzene but sodium chloride and sugar do not. It is observed that\npolar solutes dissolve in polar solvents and non polar solutes in non-\npolar solvents. In general, a solute dissolves in a solvent if the\nintermolecular interactions are similar in the two or we may say like\ndissolves like.\nWhen a solid solute is added to the solvent, some solute dissolves\nand its concentration increases in solution. This process is known as\ndissolution. Some solute particles in solution collide with the solid solute\nparticles and get separated out of solution. This process is known as\ncrystallisation. A stage is reached when the two processes occur at the\nsame rate. Under such conditions, number of solute particles going\ninto solution will be equal to the solute particles separating out and\na state of dynamic equilibrium is reached.\nSolute + Solvent ⇌ Solution (1.10)\nAt this stage the concentration of solute in solution will remain\nconstant under the given conditions, i.e., temperature and pressure.\nSimilar process is followed when gases are dissolved in liquid solvents.\nSuch a solution in which no more solute can be dissolved at the same\ntemperature and pressure is called a saturated solution. An\nunsaturated solution is one in which more solute can be dissolved at\nthe same temperature. The solution which is in dynamic equilibrium\nwith undissolved solute is the saturated solution and contains the\nmaximum amount of solute dissolved in a given amount of solvent.\nThus, the concentration of solute in such a solution is its solubility.\nEarlier we have observed that solubility of one substance into\nanother depends on the nature of the substances. In addition to these\nvariables, two other parameters, i.e., temperature and pressure also\ncontrol this phenomenon.\nEffect of temperature\nThe solubility of a solid in a liquid is significantly affected by temperature\nchanges. Consider the equilibrium represented by equation 1.10. This,\nbeing dynamic equilibrium, must follow Le Chateliers Principle. In\ngeneral, if in a nearly saturated solution, the dissolution process is\nendothermic (D H > 0), the solubility should increase with rise in\nsol\ntemperature and if it is exothermic (D H<0) the solubility should\nsol\ndecrease. These trends are also observed experimentally.\nEffect of pressure\nPressure does not have any significant effect on solubility of solids in\nliquids. It is so because solids and liquids are highly incompressible\nand practically remain unaffected by changes in pressure.\n1.3.2 Solubility of Many gases dissolve in water. Oxygen dissolves only to a small extent\na Gas in a in water. It is this dissolved oxygen which sustains all aquatic life. On\nLiquid the other hand, hydrogen chloride gas (HCl) is highly soluble in water.\nSolubility of gases in liquids is greatly affected by pressure and\nChemistry 6\nReprint 2025-26\ntemperature. The solubility of gases increase with increase of pressure.\nFor solution of gases in a solvent, consider a system as shown in\nFig. 1.1 (a). The lower part is solution and the upper part is gaseous\nsystem at pressure p and temperature T. Assume this system to be in\na state of dynamic equilibrium, i.e., under these conditions rate of\ngaseous particles entering and leaving the solution phase is the same.\nNow increase the pressure over the solution phase by compressing the\ngas to a smaller volume [Fig. 1.1 (b)]. This will increase the number of\ngaseous particles per unit volume over the solution and also the rate\nat which the gaseous particles are striking the surface of solution to\nenter it. The solubility of the gas will increase until a new equilibrium\nis reached resulting in an increase in the pressure of a gas above the\nsolution and thus its solubility increases.\nHenry was the first to give a\nquantitative relation between\npressure and solubility of a gas in\na solvent which is known as\nHenry’s law. The law states that\nat a constant temperature, the\nsolubility of a gas in a liquid is\ndirectly proportional to the\npartial pressure of the gas\npresent above the surface of\nliquid or solution. Dalton, a\ncontemporary of Henry, also\nFig. 1.1: Effect of pressure on the solubility of a gas. The concluded independently that the\nconcentration of dissolved gas is proportional to the\nsolubility of a gas in a liquid\npressure on the gas above the solution.\nsolution is a function of partial\npressure of the gas. If we use the mole fraction of a gas in\nthe solution as a measure of its solubility, then it can be\nsaid that the mole fraction of gas in the solution is\nproportional to the partial pressure of the gas over\nthe solution. The most commonly used form of Henry’s\nlaw states that “the partial pressure of the gas in\nvapour phase (p) is proportional to the mole fraction\nof the gas (x) in the solution” and is expressed as:\np = K x (1.11)\nH\nHere K is the Henry’s law constant. If we draw a\nH\ngraph between partial pressure of the gas versus mole\nfraction of the gas in solution, then we should get a plot\nof the type as shown in Fig. 1.2.\nDifferent gases have different K values at the same\nH\ntemperature (Table 1.2). This suggests that K is a\nH\nfunction of the nature of the gas.\nIt is obvious from equation (1.11) that higher the\nFig. 1.2: Experimental results for\nvalue of K at a given pressure, the lower is the solubility\nthe solubility of HCl gas in H\ncyclohexane at 293 K.

Assume that N exerts a partial\n2\npressure of 0.987 bar. Given that Henry’s law constant for N at 293 K is\n2\n76.48 kbar.\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn The solubility of gas is related to the mole fraction in aqueous solution.\nThe mole fraction of the gas in the solution is calculated by applying\nHenry’s law. Thus:\np (nitrogen) 0.987bar\nx (Nitrogen) = = = 1.29 × 10–5\nK 76,480 bar\nH\nAs 1 litre of water contains 55.5 mol of it, therefore if n represents\nnumber of moles of N in solution,\n2\nn mol n\nx (Nitrogen) = = = 1.29 × 10–5\nn mol+55.5 mol 55.5\n(n in denominator is neglected as it is < < 55.5)\nThus n = 1.29 × 10–5 × 55.5 mol = 7.16 × 10–4 mol\n7.16×104 mol × 1000 mmol\n= = 0.716 mmol\n1 mol\nHenry’s law finds several applications in industry and explains some\nbiological phenomena. Notable among these are:\n• To increase the solubility of CO in soft drinks and soda water, the\n2\nbottle is sealed under high pressure.\n• Scuba divers must cope with high concentrations of dissolved gases\nwhile breathing air at high pressure underwater. Increased pressure\nincreases the solubility of atmospheric gases in blood. When the\ndivers come towards surface, the pressure gradually decreases. This\nreleases the dissolved gases and leads to the formation of bubbles\nof nitrogen in the blood. This blocks capillaries and creates a medical\ncondition known as bends, which are painful and dangerous to life.\nChemistry 8\nReprint 2025-26\nTo avoid bends, as well as, the toxic effects of high concentrations\nof nitrogen in the blood, the tanks used by scuba divers are filled\nwith air diluted with helium (11.7% helium, 56.2% nitrogen and\n32.1% oxygen).\n• At high altitudes the partial pressure of oxygen is less than that at\nthe ground level. This leads to low concentrations of oxygen in the\nblood and tissues of people living at high altitudes or climbers. Low\nblood oxygen causes climbers to become weak and unable to think\nclearly, symptoms of a condition known as anoxia.\nEffect of Temperature\nSolubility of gases in liquids decreases with rise in temperature. When\ndissolved, the gas molecules are present in liquid phase and the process\nof dissolution can be considered similar to condensation and heat\nis evolved in this process. We have learnt in the last Section that\ndissolution process involves dynamic equilibrium and thus must\nfollow Le Chatelier’s Principle. As dissolution is an exothermic\nprocess, the solubility should decrease with increase of\ntemperature.\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n1.6 H S, a toxic gas with rotten egg like smell, is used for the qualitative analysis.

In this Section, we shall discuss the\nLLLLLiiiiiqqqqquuuuuiiiiiddddd\nsolutions of liquids and solids in a liquid. Such solutions may contain\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\none or more volatile components. Generally, the liquid solvent is volatile.\nThe solute may or may not be volatile. We shall discuss the properties\nof only binary solutions, that is, the solutions containing two\ncomponents, namely, the solutions of (i) liquids in liquids and (ii) solids\nin liquids.\n1.4.1 Vapour Let us consider a binary solution of two volatile liquids and denote the\nPressure of two components as 1 and 2. When taken in a closed vessel, both the\nLiquid- components would evaporate and eventually an equilibrium would be\nLiquid established between vapour phase and the liquid phase. Let the total\nSolutions vapour pressure at this stage be p and p and p be the partial\ntotal 1 2\nvapour pressures of the two components 1 and 2 respectively. These\npartial pressures are related to the mole fractions x and x of the two\n1 2\ncomponents 1 and 2 respectively.\nThe French chemist, Francois Marte Raoult (1886) gave the\nquantitative relationship between them. The relationship is known as\nthe Raoult’s law which states that for a solution of volatile liquids,\n9 Solutions\nReprint 2025-26\nthe partial vapour pressure of each component of the solution\nis directly proportional to its mole fraction present in solution.\nThus, for component 1\np (cid:181) x\n1 1\nand p = p0 x (1.12)\n1 1 1\nwhere p0 is the vapour pressure of pure component 1 at the same\n1\ntemperature.\nSimilarly, for component 2\np = p 0 x (1.13)\n2 2 2\nwhere p 0 represents the vapour pressure of the pure component 2.\n2\nAccording to Dalton’s law of partial pressures, the total pressure\n(p ) over the solution phase in the container will be the sum of the\ntotal\npartial pressures of the components of the solution and is given as:\np = p + p (1.14)\ntotal 1 2\nSubstituting the values of p and p , we get\n1 2\np = x p 0 + x p 0\ntotal 1 1 2 2\n= (1 – x ) p 0 + x p 0 (1.15)\n2 1 2 2\n= p 0 + (p 0 – p 0) x (1.16)\n1 2 1 2\nFollowing conclusions can be drawn from equation (1.16).\n(i) Total vapour pressure over the solution can be related to the mole\nfraction of any one component.\n(ii) Total vapour pressure over the solution varies linearly with the\nmole fraction of component 2.\n(iii) Depending on the vapour pressures\nof the pure components 1 and 2,\ntotal vapour pressure over the\nsolution decreases or increases with\nthe increase of the mole fraction of\ncomponent 1.\nA plot of p or p versus the mole\n1 2\nfractions x and x for a solution gives a\n1 2\nlinear plot as shown in Fig. 1.3. These\nlines (I and II) pass through the points for\nwhich x and x are equal to unity.\n1 2\nSimilarly the plot (line III) of p versus\ntotal\nx is also linear (Fig. 1.3).

Thus, Raoult’s law becomes\nH 1\na special case of Henry’s law in which K becomes equal to p 0.\nH 1\n1.4.3 Vapour Another important class of solutions consists of solids dissolved in\nPressure of liquid, for example, sodium chloride, glucose, urea and cane sugar in\nSolutions of water and iodine and sulphur dissolved in carbon disulphide. Some\nSolids in physical properties of these solutions are quite different from those of\nLiquids pure solvents. For example, vapour pressure. Liquids at a given\ntemperature vapourise and under\nequilibrium conditions the pressure exerted\nby the vapours of the liquid over the liquid\nphase is called vapour pressure [Fig. 1.4 (a)].\nIn a pure liquid the entire surface is\noccupied by the molecules of the liquid. If a\nnon-volatile solute is added to a solvent to\ngive a solution [Fig. 1.4.(b)], the vapour\npressure of the solution is solely from the\nsolvent alone. This vapour pressure of the\nsolution at a given temperature is found to\nbe lower than the vapour pressure of the\npure solvent at the same temperature. In\nFig. 1.4: Decrease in the vapour pressure of the the solution, the surface has both solute and\nsolvent on account of the presence of solvent molecules; thereby the fraction of the\nsolute in the solvent (a) evaporation of the surface covered by the solvent molecules gets\nmolecules of the solvent from its surface\nreduced. Consequently, the number of\nis denoted by , (b) in a solution, solute\nsolvent molecules escaping from the surface\nparticles have been denoted by and they\nis correspondingly reduced, thus, the vapour\nalso occupy part of the surface area.\npressure is also reduced.\nThe decrease in the vapour pressure of solvent depends on the\nquantity of non-volatile solute present in the solution, irrespective of\nits nature. For example, decrease in the vapour pressure of water by\nadding 1.0 mol of sucrose to one kg of water is nearly similar to that\nproduced by adding 1.0 mol of urea to the same quantity of water at\nthe same temperature.\nRaoult’s law in its general form can be stated as, for any solution\nthe partial vapour pressure of each volatile component in the\nsolution is directly proportional to its mole fraction.\nIn a binary solution, let us denote the solvent by 1 and solute by\n2. When the solute is non-volatile, only the solvent molecules are\npresent in vapour phase and contribute to vapour pressure. Let p be\n1\nChemistry 12\nReprint 2025-26\nthe vapour pressure of the solvent, x be\n1\nits mole fraction, p0 be its vapour pressure\ni\nin the pure state.

The ideal solutions have\ntwo other important properties. The enthalpy of mixing of the\npure components to form the solution is zero and the volume\nof mixing is also zero, i.e.,\nD H = 0, D V = 0 (1.21)\nmix mix\nIt means that no heat is absorbed or evolved when the components\nare mixed. Also, the volume of solution would be equal to the sum of\nvolumes of the two components. At molecular level, ideal behaviour of\nthe solutions can be explained by considering two components A and\nB. In pure components, the intermolecular attractive interactions will\nbe of types A-A and B-B, whereas in the binary solutions in addition\nto these two interactions, A-B type of interactions will also be present.\nIf the intermolecular attractive forces between the A-A and B-B are\nnearly equal to those between A-B, this leads to the formation of ideal\nsolution. A perfectly ideal solution is rare but some solutions are nearly\nideal in behaviour. Solution of n-hexane and n-heptane, bromoethane\nand chloroethane, benzene and toluene, etc. fall into this category.\n1.5.2 Non-ideal When a solution does not obey Raoult’s law over the entire range of\nSolutions concentration, then it is called non-ideal solution. The vapour pressure\nof such a solution is either higher or lower than that predicted by\nRaoult’s law (equation 1.16). If it is higher, the solution exhibits positive\ndeviation and if it is lower, it exhibits negative deviation from Raoult’s\nlaw. The plots of vapour pressure as a function of mole fractions\nfor such solutions are shown in Fig. 1.6.\nThe cause for these deviations lie in the nature of interactions at the\nmolecular level. In case of positive deviation from Raoult’s law, A-B\ninteractions are weaker than those between A-A or B-B, i.e., in this case\nthe intermolecular attractive forces between the solute-solvent molecules\nare weaker than those between the solute-solute and solvent-solvent\nmolecules. This means that in such solutions, molecules of A (or B) will\nfind it easier to escape than in pure state. This will increase the vapour\n13 Solutions\nReprint 2025-26\nFig.1.6\nThe vapour\npressures of two\ncomponent systems\nas a function of\ncomposition (a) a\nsolution that shows\npositive deviation\nfrom Raoult's law\nand (b) a solution\nthat shows negative\ndeviation from\nRaoult's law.\npressure and result in positive deviation. Mixtures of ethanol and acetone\nbehave in this manner. In pure ethanol, molecules are hydrogen bonded.\nOn adding acetone, its molecules get in between the host molecules and\nbreak some of the hydrogen bonds between them. Due to weakening of\ninteractions, the solution shows positive deviation from Raoult’s law\n[Fig. 1.6 (a)]. In a solution formed by adding carbon disulphide to\nacetone, the dipolar interactions between solute-solvent molecules are\nweaker than the respective interactions among the solute-solute and\nsolvent-solvent molecules. This solution also shows positive deviation.\nIn case of negative deviations from Raoult’s law, the intermolecular\nattractive forces between A-A and B-B are weaker than those between\nA-B and leads to decrease in vapour pressure resulting in negative\ndeviations. An example of this type is a mixture of phenol and aniline.\nIn this case the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between phenolic\nproton and lone pair on nitrogen atom of aniline is stronger than the\nrespective intermolecular hydrogen bonding between similar\nmolecules. Similarly, a mixture of chloroform and acetone\nforms a solution with negative deviation from Raoult’s law.\nThis is because chloroform molecule is able to form hydrogen\nbond with acetone molecule as shown.\nThis decreases the escaping tendency of molecules for each\ncomponent and consequently the vapour pressure decreases resulting\nin negative deviation from Raoult’s law [Fig. 1.6. (b)].\nSome liquids on mixing, form azeotropes which are binary mixtures\nhaving the same composition in liquid and vapour phase and boil at\na constant temperature. In such cases, it is not possible to separate the\ncomponents by fractional distillation. There are two types of azeotropes\ncalled minimum boiling azeotrope and maximum boiling\nazeotrope. The solutions which show a large positive deviation from\nRaoult’s law form minimum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition.\nChemistry 14\nReprint 2025-26\nFor example, ethanol-water mixture (obtained by fermentation of sugars)\non fractional distillation gives a solution containing approximately 95%\nby volume of ethanol. Once this composition, known as azeotrope\ncomposition, has been achieved, the liquid and vapour have the same\ncomposition, and no further separation occurs.\nThe solutions that show large negative deviation from Raoult’s law\nform maximum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition. Nitric acid\nand water is an example of this class of azeotrope. This azeotrope has\nthe approximate composition, 68% nitric acid and 32% water by mass,\nwith a boiling point of 393.5 K.\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\n1.8 The vapour pressure of pure liquids A and B are 450 and 700 mm Hg\nrespectively, at 350 K .

Such properties are called\ncolligative properties (colligative: from Latin: co means together, ligare\nmeans to bind). In the following Sections we will discuss these\nproperties one by one.\n1.6.1 Relative We have learnt in Section 1.4.3 that the vapour pressure of a solvent in\nLowering of solution is less than that of the pure solvent. Raoult established that the\nVapour lowering of vapour pressure depends only on the concentration of the\nPressure solute particles and it is independent of their identity.

It boils at the temperature at which its vapour pressure\nis equal to the atmospheric pressure. For example, water boils at\n373.15 K (100° C) because at this temperature the vapour pressure\nof water is 1.013 bar (1 atmosphere). We have also learnt in the last\nsection that vapour pressure of the solvent decreases in the presence\nof non-volatile solute. Fig. 1.7 depicts the variation of vapour pressure\nof the pure solvent and solution as a function of temperature. For\nexample, the vapour pressure of an aqueous solution of sucrose is\nless than 1.013 bar at 373.15 K. In order to make this solution\nboil, its vapour pressure must be increased to 1.013 bar by\nraising the temperature above the boiling temperature of\nthe pure solvent (water). Thus, the boiling point of a solution is\nChemistry 16\nReprint 2025-26\nalways higher than that of the boiling point of\nthe pure solvent in which the solution is prepared\n1.013 bar as shown in Fig. 1.7. Similar to lowering of vapour\nor pressure, the elevation of boiling point also\ndepends on the number of solute molecules\nrather than their nature. A solution of 1 mol of\nsucrose in 1000 g of water boils at 373.52 K at\none atmospheric pressure.\nLet T0 be the boiling point of pure solvent and\nb\nT be the boiling point of solution.

Thus, the\nfreezing point of a substance may be defined as\nthe temperature at which the vapour pressure of\nthe substance in its liquid phase is equal to its\nvapour pressure in the solid phase. A solution\nwill freeze when its vapour pressure equals the\nvapour pressure of the pure solid solvent as is\nclear from Fig. 1.8.

Small solvent\nChemistry 20\nReprint 2025-26\nmolecules, like water, can pass through these holes but the passage of\nbigger molecules like solute is hindered. Membranes having this kind\nof properties are known as semipermeable membranes (SPM).\nAssume that only solvent molecules can pass through these semi-\npermeable membranes. If this membrane is placed between the solvent\nand solution as shown in Fig. 1.9, the solvent molecules will flow through\nthe membrane from pure solvent to the solution. This process of flow\nof the solvent is called osmosis.\nThe flow will continue till the equilibrium is attained. The flow of the\nsolvent from its side to solution side across a semipermeable membrane\ncan be stopped if some extra pressure is applied on the solution. This\npressure that just stops the flow of solvent is called osmotic\npressure of the solution. The flow of solvent from dilute solution to\nthe concentrated solution across a semipermeable membrane is due to\nosmosis. The important point to be kept in mind is that solvent molecules\nalways flow from lower concentration to higher concentration of solution.\nThe osmotic pressure has been found to depend on the concentration\nof the solution.\nThe osmotic pressure of a solution is the\nexcess pressure that must be applied to a\nsolution to prevent osmosis, i.e., to stop the\npassage of solvent molecules through a\nsemipermeable membrane into the solution. This\nis illustrated in Fig. 1.10. Osmotic pressure is a\ncolligative property as it depends on the number\nof solute molecules and not on their identity.\nFor dilute solutions, it has been found\nexperimentally that osmotic pressure is\nproportional to the molarity, C of the\nsolution at a given temperature T. Thus:\nP = C R T (1.39)\nFig. 1.10: The excess pressure equal to the\nHere P is the osmotic pressure and R is the\nosmotic pressure must be applied on\ngas constant.\nthe solution side to prevent osmosis.\nP = (n /V) R T (1.40)\n2\nHere V is volume of a solution in litres containing n moles of solute.\n2\nIf w grams of solute, of molar mass, M is present in the solution, then\n2 2\nn = w / M and we can write,\n2 2 2\nw R T\nP V = 2 (1.41)\nM\n2\nw R T\nor M = 2 (1.42)\n2 (cid:213) V\nThus, knowing the quantities w , T, P and V we can calculate the\n2\nmolar mass of the solute.\nMeasurement of osmotic pressure provides another method of\ndetermining molar masses of solutes. This method is widely used to\ndetermine molar masses of proteins, polymers and other\n21 Solutions\nReprint 2025-26\nmacromolecules. The osmotic pressure method has the advantage over\nother methods as pressure measurement is around the room\ntemperature and the molarity of the solution is used instead of molality.\nAs compared to other colligative properties, its magnitude is large\neven for very dilute solutions. The technique of osmotic pressure for\ndetermination of molar mass of solutes is particularly useful for\nbiomolecules as they are generally not stable at higher temperatures\nand polymers have poor solubility.\nTwo solutions having same osmotic pressure at a given\ntemperature are called isotonic solutions. When such solutions\nare separated by semipermeable membrane no osmosis occurs\nbetween them. For example, the osmotic pressure associated\nwith the fluid inside the blood cell is equivalent to that of\n0.9% (mass/volume) sodium chloride solution, called normal saline\nsolution and it is safe to inject intravenously. On the other hand, if\nwe place the cells in a solution containing more than 0.9% (mass/\nvolume) sodium chloride, water will flow out of the cells and they\nwould shrink. Such a solution is called hypertonic. If the salt\nconcentration is less than 0.9% (mass/volume), the solution is said\nto be hypotonic. In this case, water will flow into the cells if placed\nin this solution and they would swell.\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 11111.....1111111111 200 cm3 of an aqueous solution of a protein contains 1.26 g of the\nprotein.

A raw mango placed in concentrated\nsalt solution loses water via osmosis and shrivel into pickle. Wilted\nflowers revive when placed in fresh water. A carrot that has become\nlimp because of water loss into the atmosphere can be placed into the\nwater making it firm once again. Water will move into its cells through\nosmosis. When placed in water containing less than 0.9% (mass/\nvolume) salt, blood cells swell due to flow of water in them by osmosis.\nPeople taking a lot of salt or salty food experience water retention in\ntissue cells and intercellular spaces because of osmosis. The resulting\nChemistry 22\nReprint 2025-26\npuffiness or swelling is called edema. Water movement from soil into\nplant roots and subsequently into upper portion of the plant is partly\ndue to osmosis. The preservation of meat by salting and of fruits by\nadding sugar protects against bacterial action. Through the process\nof osmosis, a bacterium on salted meat or candid fruit loses water,\nshrivels and dies.\n1.6.5 Reverse The direction of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure larger than the\nOsmosis and osmotic pressure is applied to the solution side. That is, now the\nWater pure solvent flows out of the solution through the semi permeable\nPurification membrane. This phenomenon is called reverse osmosis and is of\ngreat practical utility. Reverse osmosis is used in desalination of sea\nwater. A schematic set up for the process is shown in Fig. 1.11.\nWhen pressure more than osmotic pressure is\napplied, pure water is squeezed out of the sea\nwater through the membrane. A variety of\nΠ\npolymer membranes are available for this\npurpose.\nThe pressure required for the reverse osmosis\nis quite high. A workable porous membrane is a\nfilm of cellulose acetate placed over a suitable\nsupport. Cellulose acetate is permeable to water\nbut impermeable to impurities and ions present\nin sea water. These days many countries use\nFig. 1.11: Reverse osmosis occurs when a\npressure larger than the osmotic desalination plants to meet their potable water\npressure is applied to the solution. requirements.\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n1.9 Vapour pressure of pure water at 298 K is 23.8 mm Hg. 50 g of urea\n(NH CONH ) is dissolved in 850 g of water.

For example, if we dissolve one mole of KCl (74.5 g)\nin water, we expect one mole each of K+ and Cl– ions to be released in\nMMMMMaaaaasssssssssseeeeesssss\nthe solution. If this happens, there would be two moles of particles in\nthe solution. If we ignore interionic attractions, one mole of KCl in\none kg of water would be expected to increase the boiling point by\n2 × 0.52 K = 1.04 K. Now if we did not know about the degree of\n23 Solutions\nReprint 2025-26\ndissociation, we could be led to conclude that the mass of 2 mol particles\nis 74.5 g and the mass of one mole of KCl would be 37.25 g. This\nbrings into light the rule that, when there is dissociation of solute into\nions, the experimentally determined molar mass is always lower than\nthe true value.\n2 CH COOH ⇌ (CH COOH) Molecules of ethanoic acid (acetic acid) dimerise in\n3 3 2\nbenzene due to hydrogen bonding. This normally happens\nin solvents of low dielectric constant. In this case the number\nof particles is reduced due to dimerisation. Association of\nmolecules is depicted as follows:\nIt can be undoubtedly stated here that if all the molecules of ethanoic\nacid associate in benzene, then DT or DT for ethanoic acid will be half\nb f\nof the normal value. The molar mass calculated on the basis of this DT\nb\nor DT will, therefore, be twice the expected value. Such a molar mass\nf\nthat is either lower or higher than the expected or normal value is called\nas abnormal molar mass.\nIn 1880 van’t Hoff introduced a factor i, known as the van’t Hoff\nfactor, to account for the extent of dissociation or association. This\nfactor i is defined as:\nNormal molar mass\ni \nAbnormal molar mass\nObserved colligative property\n\nCalculated colligative property\nTotal number of moles of particles after association/dissociation\ni \nNumber of moles of particles before association/dissociation\nHere abnormal molar mass is the experimentally determined molar\nmass and calculated colligative properties are obtained by assuming\nthat the non-volatile solute is neither associated nor dissociated. In\ncase of association, value of i is less than unity while for dissociation it\nis greater than unity. For example, the value of i for aqueous KCl\nsolution is close to 2, while the value for ethanoic acid in benzene is\nnearly 0.5.\nInclusion of van’t Hoff factor modifies the equations for colligative\nproperties as follows:\nRelative lowering of vapour pressure of solvent,\npo – p n\n1 1 i. 2\npo n\n1 1\nElevation of Boiling point, DT = i K m\nb b\nDepression of Freezing point, DT = i K m\nf f\nOsmotic pressure of solution, P = i n R T / V\n2\nChemistry 24\nReprint 2025-26\nTable 1.4 depicts values of the factor, i for several strong electrolytes.\nFor KCl, NaCl and MgSO , i values approach 2 as the solution becomes\n4\nvery dilute.

Solutions are\nclassified as solid, liquid and gaseous solutions. The concentration of a solution is\nexpressed in terms of mole fraction, molarity, molality and in percentages. The\ndissolution of a gas in a liquid is governed by Henry’s law, according to which, at a\ngiven temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to\nthe partial pressure of the gas. The vapour pressure of the solvent is lowered by\nthe presence of a non-volatile solute in the solution and this lowering of vapour\npressure of the solvent is governed by Raoult’s law, according to which the relative\nlowering of vapour pressure of the solvent over a solution is equal to the mole\nfraction of a non-volatile solute present in the solution. However, in a binary\nliquid solution, if both the components of the solution are volatile then another\nform of Raoult’s law is used. Mathematically, this form of the Raoult’s law is stated\nas:p  p0x p0x . Solutions which obey Raoult’s law over the entire range\ntotal 1 1 2 2\nof concentration are called ideal solutions. Two types of deviations from Raoult’s\nlaw, called positive and negative deviations are observed. Azeotropes arise due to\nvery large deviations from Raoult’s law.\nThe properties of solutions which depend on the number of solute particles and\nare independent of their chemical identity are called colligative properties. These\nare lowering of vapour pressure, elevation of boiling point, depression of freezing\npoint and osmotic pressure. The process of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure\nhigher than the osmotic pressure is applied to the solution. Colligative properties\nhave been used to determine the molar mass of solutes. Solutes which dissociate in\nsolution exhibit molar mass lower than the actual molar mass and those which\nassociate show higher molar mass than their actual values.\nQuantitatively, the extent to which a solute is dissociated or associated can be\nexpressed by van’t Hoff factor i. This factor has been defined as ratio of normal\nmolar mass to experimentally determined molar mass or as the ratio of observed\ncolligative property to the calculated colligative property.\nEEEEExxxxxeeeeerrrrrccccciiiiissssseeeeesssss\n1.1 Define the term solution.

Types of solutions; express concentration of solution in different units; In normal life we rarely come across pure substances. Most of these are mixtures containing two or more pure state and explain Henry s law and Raoult s law; substances. Their utility or importance in life depends on their composition. For example, the properties of distinguish between ideal and non - ideal solutions; brass(mixture of copper and zinc) are quite different from those of German silver(mixture of copper, zinc explain deviations of real solutions from Raoult s law; and nickel) or bronze(mixture of copper and tin); 1 part per million(ppm) of fluoride ions in water describe colligative properties of prevents tooth decay, while 1. 5 ppm causes the tooth solutions and correlate these with molar masses of the solutes; to become mottled and high concentrations of fluoride ions can be poisonous(for example, sodium fluoride is explain abnormal colligative properties exhibited by some used in rat poison); intravenous injections are always solutes in solutions. Dissolved in water containing salts at particular ionic concentrations that match with blood plasma concentrations and so on. In this Unit, we will consider mostly liquid solutions and their formation. This will be followed by studying the properties of the solutions, like vapour pressure and colligative properties. We will begin with types of solutions and then various alternatives in which concentrations of a solute can be expressed in liquid solution. 11111. 11111 Types of Solutions are homogeneous mixtures of two or more than two Solutions components. By homogenous mixture we mean that its composition and properties are uniform throughout the mixture. Generally, the component that is present in the largest quantity is known as solvent. Solvent determines the physical state in which solution exists. One or more components present in the solution other than solvent are called solutes. In this Unit we shall consider only binary solutions(i. e., Reprint 2025 - 26 consisting of two components). Here each component may be solid, liquid or in gaseous state and are summarised in Table 1. 1. Table 1. 1: Types of Solutions Type of Solution Solute Solvent Common Examples Gaseous Solutions Gas Gas Mixture of oxygen and nitrogen gases Liquid Gas Chloroform mixed with nitrogen gas Solid Gas Camphor in nitrogen gas Liquid Solutions Gas Liquid Oxygen dissolved in water Liquid Liquid Ethanol dissolved in water Solid Liquid Glucose dissolved in water Solid Solutions Gas Solid Solution of hydrogen in palladium Liquid Solid Amalgam of mercury with sodium Solid Solid Copper dissolved in gold Composition of a solution can be described by expressing its 11111. 22222 Expresing concentration. The latter can be expressed either qualitatively Concentration or quantitatively. For example, qualitatively we can say that the of Solutions solution is dilute(i. e., relatively very small quantity of solute) or it is concentrated(i. e., relatively very large quantity of solute). But in real life these kinds of description can add to lot of confusion and thus the need for a quantitative description of the solution. There are several ways by which we can describe the concentration of the solution quantitatively.(i) Mass percentage(w / w): The mass percentage of a component of a solution is defined as: Mass % of a component Mass of the component in the solution = 100(1. 1) Total mass of the solution For example, if a solution is described by 10 % glucose in water by mass, it means that 10g of glucose is dissolved in 90 g of water resulting in a 100 g solution. Concentration described by mass percentage is commonly used in industrial chemical applications. For example, commercial bleaching solution contains 3. 62 mass percentage of sodium hypochlorite in water.(ii) Volume percentage(V / V): The volume percentage is defined as: Volume of the component Volume % of a component = 100 Total volume of solution(1. 2) Chemistry 2 Reprint 2025 - 26 For example, 10 % ethanol solution in water means that 10 Ml of ethanol is dissolved in water such that the total volume of the solution is 100 Ml. Solutions containing liquids are commonly expressed in this unit. For example, a 35 %(v / v) solution of ethylene glycol, an antifreeze, is used in cars for cooling the engine. At this concentration the antifreeze lowers the freezing point of water to 255. 4K(17. 6 ° C).(i) Mass by volume percentage(w / V): Another unit which is commonly used in medicine and pharmacy is mass by volume percentage. It is the mass of solute dissolved in 100 Ml of the solution.(iv) Parts per million: When a solute is present in trace quantities, it is convenient to express concentration in parts per million(ppm) and is defined as: Parts per million = Numberof parts of the component × 106(1. 3) Total number of parts of all components of the solution As in the case of percentage, concentration in parts per million can also be expressed as mass to mass, volume to volume and mass to volume. A litre of sea water(which weighs 1030 g) contains about 6 × 10 3 g of dissolved oxygen(O). Such a small concentration is 2 also expressed as 5. 8 g per 106 g(5. 8 ppm) of sea water. The concentration of pollutants in water or atmosphere is often expressed in terms of mg Ml 1 or ppm.(v) Mole fraction: Commonly used symbol for mole fraction is x and subscript used on the right hand side of x denotes the component. It is defined as: Mole fraction of a component = Number of moles of the component(1. 4) Total number of moles of all the components For example, in a binary mixture, if the number of moles of A and B are n and n respectively, the mole fraction of A will be A B n x = A(1. 5) A n n A B For a solution containing i number of components, we have: n n x = i = i(1. 6) i n n. N n 1 2 i i It can be shown that in a given solution sum of all the mole fractions is unity, i. e. X + x +. + x = 1(1. 7) 1 2 i Mole fraction unit is very useful in relating some physical properties of solutions, say vapour pressure with the concentration of the solution and quite useful in describing the calculations involving gas mixtures. 3 Solutions Reprint 2025 - 26 Example 11111. 11111 Calculate the mole fraction of ethylene glycol(C H O) in a solution 2 6 2 containing 20 % of C H O by mass. 2 6 2 Solution Assume that we have 100 g of solution(one can start with any amount of solution because the results obtained will be the same).

Example 11111. 22222 Calculate the molarity of a solution containing 5 g of NaOH in 450 Ml solution.

Each method of expressing concentration of the solutions has its own merits and demerits. Mass %, ppm, mole fraction and molality are independent of temperature, whereas molarity is a function of temperature. This is because volume depends on temperature and the mass does not.

It depends upon the nature of solute and solvent as well as temperature and pressure. Let us consider the effect of these factors in solution of a solid or a gas in a liquid. 5 Solutions Reprint 2025 - 26 1. 3. 1 Solubility of Every solid does not dissolve in a given liquid. While sodium chloride a Solid in a and sugar dissolve readily in water, naphthalene and anthracene do Liquid not. On the other hand, naphthalene and anthracene dissolve readily in benzene but sodium chloride and sugar do not. It is observed that polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents and non polar solutes in non - polar solvents. In general, a solute dissolves in a solvent if the intermolecular interactions are similar in the two or we may say like dissolves like. When a solid solute is added to the solvent, some solute dissolves and its concentration increases in solution. This process is known as dissolution. Some solute particles in solution collide with the solid solute particles and get separated out of solution. This process is known as crystallisation. A stage is reached when the two processes occur at the same rate. Under such conditions, number of solute particles going into solution will be equal to the solute particles separating out and a state of dynamic equilibrium is reached. Solute + Solvent Solution(1. 10) At this stage the concentration of solute in solution will remain constant under the given conditions, i. e., temperature and pressure. Similar process is followed when gases are dissolved in liquid solvents. Such a solution in which no more solute can be dissolved at the same temperature and pressure is called a saturated solution. An unsaturated solution is one in which more solute can be dissolved at the same temperature. The solution which is in dynamic equilibrium with undissolved solute is the saturated solution and contains the maximum amount of solute dissolved in a given amount of solvent. Thus, the concentration of solute in such a solution is its solubility. Earlier we have observed that solubility of one substance into another depends on the nature of the substances. In addition to these variables, two other parameters, i. e., temperature and pressure also control this phenomenon. Effect of temperature The solubility of a solid in a liquid is significantly affected by temperature changes. Consider the equilibrium represented by equation 1. 10. This, being dynamic equilibrium, must follow Le Chateliers Principle. In general, if in a nearly saturated solution, the dissolution process is endothermic(D H > 0), the solubility should increase with rise in sol temperature and if it is exothermic(D H < 0) the solubility should sol decrease. These trends are also observed experimentally. Effect of pressure Pressure does not have any significant effect on solubility of solids in liquids. It is so because solids and liquids are highly incompressible and practically remain unaffected by changes in pressure. 1. 3. 2 Solubility of Many gases dissolve in water. Oxygen dissolves only to a small extent a Gas in a in water. It is this dissolved oxygen which sustains all aquatic life. On Liquid the other hand, hydrogen chloride gas(Hcl) is highly soluble in water. Solubility of gases in liquids is greatly affected by pressure and Chemistry 6 Reprint 2025 - 26 temperature. The solubility of gases increase with increase of pressure. For solution of gases in a solvent, consider a system as shown in Fig. 1. 1(a). The lower part is solution and the upper part is gaseous system at pressure p and temperature T. Assume this system to be in a state of dynamic equilibrium, i. e., under these conditions rate of gaseous particles entering and leaving the solution phase is the same. Now increase the pressure over the solution phase by compressing the gas to a smaller volume[Fig. 1. 1(b)]. This will increase the number of gaseous particles per unit volume over the solution and also the rate at which the gaseous particles are striking the surface of solution to enter it. The solubility of the gas will increase until a new equilibrium is reached resulting in an increase in the pressure of a gas above the solution and thus its solubility increases. Henry was the first to give a quantitative relation between pressure and solubility of a gas in a solvent which is known as Henry s law. The law states that at a constant temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas present above the surface of liquid or solution. Dalton, a contemporary of Henry, also Fig. 1. 1: Effect of pressure on the solubility of a gas. The concluded independently that the concentration of dissolved gas is proportional to the solubility of a gas in a liquid pressure on the gas above the solution. Solution is a function of partial pressure of the gas. If we use the mole fraction of a gas in the solution as a measure of its solubility, then it can be said that the mole fraction of gas in the solution is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas over the solution. The most commonly used form of Henry s law states that the partial pressure of the gas in vapour phase(p) is proportional to the mole fraction of the gas(x) in the solution and is expressed as: p = K x(1. 11) H Here K is the Henry s law constant. If we draw a H graph between partial pressure of the gas versus mole fraction of the gas in solution, then we should get a plot of the type as shown in Fig. 1. 2. Different gases have different K values at the same H temperature(Table 1. 2). This suggests that K is a H function of the nature of the gas. It is obvious from equation(1. 11) that higher the Fig. 1. 2: Experimental results for value of K at a given pressure, the lower is the solubility the solubility of Hcl gas in H cyclohexane at 293 K. The of the gas in the liquid. It can be seen from Table 1. 2 slope of the line is the that K values for both N and O increase with increase H 2 2 Henry s Law constant, K. Of temperature indicating that the solubility of gases H 7 Solutions Reprint 2025 - 26 Table 1. 2: Values of Henry ' s Law Constant for Some Selected Gases in Water Gas Temperature / K K / kbar Gas Temperature / K K / kbar H H He 293 144. 97 Argon 298 40. 3 H 293 69. 16 2 CO 298 1. 67 2 N 293 76. 48 2 Formaldehyde 298 1. 83 × 10 - 5 N 303 88. 84 2 Methane 298 0. 413 O 293 34. 86 2 O 303 46. 82 Vinyl chloride 298 0. 611 2 increases with decrease of temperature. It is due to this reason that aquatic species are more comfortable in cold waters rather than in warm waters. Example 11111. 44444 If N gas is bubbled through water at 293 K, how many millimoles of N 2 2 gas would dissolve in 1 litre of water? Assume that N exerts a partial 2 pressure of 0. 987 bar. Given that Henry s law constant for N at 293 K is 2 76. 48 kbar. Solution The solubility of gas is related to the mole fraction in aqueous solution. The mole fraction of the gas in the solution is calculated by applying Henry s law. Thus: p(nitrogen) 0. 987bar x(Nitrogen) = = = 1. 29 × 10 5 K 76, 480 bar H As 1 litre of water contains 55. 5 mol of it, therefore if n represents number of moles of N in solution, 2 n mol n x(Nitrogen) = = = 1. 29 × 10 5 n mol + 55. 5 mol 55. 5(n in denominator is neglected as it is < < 55. 5) Thus n = 1. 29 × 10 5 × 55. 5 mol = 7. 16 × 10 4 mol 7. 16 × 10 4 mol × 1000 mmol = = 0. 716 mmol 1 mol Henry s law finds several applications in industry and explains some biological phenomena. Notable among these are: To increase the solubility of CO in soft drinks and soda water, the 2 bottle is sealed under high pressure. Scuba divers must cope with high concentrations of dissolved gases while breathing air at high pressure underwater. Increased pressure increases the solubility of atmospheric gases in blood. When the divers come towards surface, the pressure gradually decreases. This releases the dissolved gases and leads to the formation of bubbles of nitrogen in the blood. This blocks capillaries and creates a medical condition known as bends, which are painful and dangerous to life. Chemistry 8 Reprint 2025 - 26 To avoid bends, as well as, the toxic effects of high concentrations of nitrogen in the blood, the tanks used by scuba divers are filled with air diluted with helium(11. 7 % helium, 56. 2 % nitrogen and 32. 1 % oxygen). At high altitudes the partial pressure of oxygen is less than that at the ground level. This leads to low concentrations of oxygen in the blood and tissues of people living at high altitudes or climbers. Low blood oxygen causes climbers to become weak and unable to think clearly, symptoms of a condition known as anoxia. Effect of Temperature Solubility of gases in liquids decreases with rise in temperature. When dissolved, the gas molecules are present in liquid phase and the process of dissolution can be considered similar to condensation and heat is evolved in this process. We have learnt in the last Section that dissolution process involves dynamic equilibrium and thus must follow Le Chatelier s Principle. As dissolution is an exothermic process, the solubility should decrease with increase of temperature.

The solute can be Presure of a gas, a liquid or a solid. Solutions of gases in liquids have already been discussed in Section 1. 3. 2. In this Section, we shall discuss the Liquid solutions of liquids and solids in a liquid. Such solutions may contain Solutions one or more volatile components. Generally, the liquid solvent is volatile. The solute may or may not be volatile. We shall discuss the properties of only binary solutions, that is, the solutions containing two components, namely, the solutions of(i) liquids in liquids and(ii) solids in liquids. 1. 4. 1 Vapour Let us consider a binary solution of two volatile liquids and denote the Pressure of two components as 1 and 2. When taken in a closed vessel, both the Liquid - components would evaporate and eventually an equilibrium would be Liquid established between vapour phase and the liquid phase. Let the total Solutions vapour pressure at this stage be p and p and p be the partial total 1 2 vapour pressures of the two components 1 and 2 respectively. These partial pressures are related to the mole fractions x and x of the two 1 2 components 1 and 2 respectively. The French chemist, Francois Marte Raoult(1886) gave the quantitative relationship between them. The relationship is known as the Raoult s law which states that for a solution of volatile liquids, 9 Solutions Reprint 2025 - 26 the partial vapour pressure of each component of the solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction present in solution. Thus, for component 1 p(cid: 181) x 1 1 and p = p0 x(1. 12) 1 1 1 where p0 is the vapour pressure of pure component 1 at the same 1 temperature. Similarly, for component 2 p = p 0 x(1. 13) 2 2 2 where p 0 represents the vapour pressure of the pure component 2. 2 According to Dalton s law of partial pressures, the total pressure(p) over the solution phase in the container will be the sum of the total partial pressures of the components of the solution and is given as: p = p + p(1. 14) total 1 2 Substituting the values of p and p, we get 1 2 p = x p 0 + x p 0 total 1 1 2 2 =(1 x) p 0 + x p 0(1. 15) 2 1 2 2 = p 0 +(p 0 p 0) x(1. 16) 1 2 1 2 Following conclusions can be drawn from equation(1. 16).(i) Total vapour pressure over the solution can be related to the mole fraction of any one component.(ii) Total vapour pressure over the solution varies linearly with the mole fraction of component 2.(i) Depending on the vapour pressures of the pure components 1 and 2, total vapour pressure over the solution decreases or increases with the increase of the mole fraction of component 1. A plot of p or p versus the mole 1 2 fractions x and x for a solution gives a 1 2 linear plot as shown in Fig. 1. 3. These lines(I and II) pass through the points for which x and x are equal to unity. 1 2 Similarly the plot(line I) of p versus total x is also linear(Fig. 1. 3). The minimum 2 value of p is p 0and the maximum value total 1 Fig. 1. 3: The plot of vapour pressure and mole is p 0, assuming that component 1 is less fraction of an ideal solution at constant 2 volatile than component 2, i. e., p 0 < p 0.

In the solution of a gas in a i i i special case liquid, one of the components is so volatile that it exists as a gas and of Henry s we have already seen that its solubility is given by Henry s law which Law states that p = K x. H If we compare the equations for Raoult s law and Henry s law, it can be seen that the partial pressure of the volatile component or gas is directly proportional to its mole fraction in solution. Only the proportionality constant K differs from p 0. Thus, Raoult s law becomes H 1 a special case of Henry s law in which K becomes equal to p 0. H 1 1. 4. 3 Vapour Another important class of solutions consists of solids dissolved in Pressure of liquid, for example, sodium chloride, glucose, urea and cane sugar in Solutions of water and iodine and sulphur dissolved in carbon disulphide. Some Solids in physical properties of these solutions are quite different from those of Liquids pure solvents. For example, vapour pressure. Liquids at a given temperature vapourise and under equilibrium conditions the pressure exerted by the vapours of the liquid over the liquid phase is called vapour pressure[Fig. 1. 4(a)]. In a pure liquid the entire surface is occupied by the molecules of the liquid. If a non - volatile solute is added to a solvent to give a solution[Fig. 1. 4.(b)], the vapour pressure of the solution is solely from the solvent alone. This vapour pressure of the solution at a given temperature is found to be lower than the vapour pressure of the pure solvent at the same temperature. In Fig. 1. 4: Decrease in the vapour pressure of the the solution, the surface has both solute and solvent on account of the presence of solvent molecules; thereby the fraction of the solute in the solvent(a) evaporation of the surface covered by the solvent molecules gets molecules of the solvent from its surface reduced. Consequently, the number of is denoted by,(b) in a solution, solute solvent molecules escaping from the surface particles have been denoted by and they is correspondingly reduced, thus, the vapour also occupy part of the surface area. Pressure is also reduced. The decrease in the vapour pressure of solvent depends on the quantity of non - volatile solute present in the solution, irrespective of its nature. For example, decrease in the vapour pressure of water by adding 1. 0 mol of sucrose to one kg of water is nearly similar to that produced by adding 1. 0 mol of urea to the same quantity of water at the same temperature. Raoult s law in its general form can be stated as, for any solution the partial vapour pressure of each volatile component in the solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction. In a binary solution, let us denote the solvent by 1 and solute by 2. When the solute is non - volatile, only the solvent molecules are present in vapour phase and contribute to vapour pressure. Let p be 1 Chemistry 12 Reprint 2025 - 26 the vapour pressure of the solvent, x be 1 its mole fraction, p0 be its vapour pressure i in the pure state. Then according to Raoult s law Fig. 1. 5 p(cid: 181) x If a solution obeys 1 1 Raoult ' s law for all and p 1 = x 1 p 1 0(1. 20) concentrations, its The proportionality constant is equal vapour pressure to the vapour pressure of pure solvent, p0. Would vary linearly 1 from zero to the A plot between the vapour pressure and vapour pressure of the mole fraction of the solvent is linear the pure solvent.(Fig. 1. 5). 11111. 55555 Ideal and Non - Liquid - liquid solutions can be classified into ideal and non - ideal ideal Solutions solutions on the basis of Raoult s law. 1. 5. 1 Ideal The solutions which obey Raoult s law over the entire range of Solutions concentration are known as ideal solutions. The ideal solutions have two other important properties. The enthalpy of mixing of the pure components to form the solution is zero and the volume of mixing is also zero, i. e., D H = 0, D V = 0(1. 21) mix mix It means that no heat is absorbed or evolved when the components are mixed. Also, the volume of solution would be equal to the sum of volumes of the two components. At molecular level, ideal behaviour of the solutions can be explained by considering two components A and B. In pure components, the intermolecular attractive interactions will be of types A - A and B - B, whereas in the binary solutions in addition to these two interactions, A - B type of interactions will also be present. If the intermolecular attractive forces between the A - A and B - B are nearly equal to those between A - B, this leads to the formation of ideal solution. A perfectly ideal solution is rare but some solutions are nearly ideal in behaviour. Solution of n - hexane and n - heptane, bromoethane and chloroethane, benzene and toluene, etc. Fall into this category. 1. 5. 2 Non - ideal When a solution does not obey Raoult s law over the entire range of Solutions concentration, then it is called non - ideal solution. The vapour pressure of such a solution is either higher or lower than that predicted by Raoult s law(equation 1. 16). If it is higher, the solution exhibits positive deviation and if it is lower, it exhibits negative deviation from Raoult s law. The plots of vapour pressure as a function of mole fractions for such solutions are shown in Fig. 1. 6. The cause for these deviations lie in the nature of interactions at the molecular level. In case of positive deviation from Raoult s law, A - B interactions are weaker than those between A - A or B - B, i. e., in this case the intermolecular attractive forces between the solute - solvent molecules are weaker than those between the solute - solute and solvent - solvent molecules. This means that in such solutions, molecules of A(or B) will find it easier to escape than in pure state. This will increase the vapour 13 Solutions Reprint 2025 - 26 Fig. 1. 6 The vapour pressures of two component systems as a function of composition(a) a solution that shows positive deviation from Raoult ' s law and(b) a solution that shows negative deviation from Raoult ' s law. Pressure and result in positive deviation. Mixtures of ethanol and acetone behave in this manner. In pure ethanol, molecules are hydrogen bonded. On adding acetone, its molecules get in between the host molecules and break some of the hydrogen bonds between them. Due to weakening of interactions, the solution shows positive deviation from Raoult s law[Fig. 1. 6(a)]. In a solution formed by adding carbon disulphide to acetone, the dipolar interactions between solute - solvent molecules are weaker than the respective interactions among the solute - solute and solvent - solvent molecules. This solution also shows positive deviation. In case of negative deviations from Raoult s law, the intermolecular attractive forces between A - A and B - B are weaker than those between A - B and leads to decrease in vapour pressure resulting in negative deviations. An example of this type is a mixture of phenol and aniline. In this case the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between phenolic proton and lone pair on nitrogen atom of aniline is stronger than the respective intermolecular hydrogen bonding between similar molecules. Similarly, a mixture of chloroform and acetone forms a solution with negative deviation from Raoult s law. This is because chloroform molecule is able to form hydrogen bond with acetone molecule as shown. This decreases the escaping tendency of molecules for each component and consequently the vapour pressure decreases resulting in negative deviation from Raoult s law[Fig. 1. 6.(b)]. Some liquids on mixing, form azeotropes which are binary mixtures having the same composition in liquid and vapour phase and boil at a constant temperature. In such cases, it is not possible to separate the components by fractional distillation. There are two types of azeotropes called minimum boiling azeotrope and maximum boiling azeotrope. The solutions which show a large positive deviation from Raoult s law form minimum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition. Chemistry 14 Reprint 2025 - 26 For example, ethanol - water mixture(obtained by fermentation of sugars) on fractional distillation gives a solution containing approximately 95 % by volume of ethanol. Once this composition, known as azeotrope composition, has been achieved, the liquid and vapour have the same composition, and no further separation occurs. The solutions that show large negative deviation from Raoult s law form maximum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition. Nitric acid and water is an example of this class of azeotrope. This azeotrope has the approximate composition, 68 % nitric acid and 32 % water by mass, with a boiling point of 393. 5 K. Intext Question 1. 8 The vapour pressure of pure liquids A and B are 450 and 700 mm Hg respectively, at 350 K. Find out the composition of the liquid mixture if total vapour pressure is 600 mm Hg. Also find the composition of the vapour phase. 11111. 66666 Coligative We have learnt in Section 1. 4. 3 that the vapour pressure of solution decreases when a non - volatile solute is added to a volatile solvent. Properties and There are many properties of solutions which are connected with this Determination decrease of vapour pressure. These are:(1) relative lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent(2) depression of freezing point of the solvent of Molar Mas(3) elevation of boiling point of the solvent and(4) osmotic pressure of the solution. All these properties depend on the number of solute particles irrespective of their nature relative to the total number of particles present in the solution. Such properties are called colligative properties(colligative: from Latin: co means together, ligare means to bind). In the following Sections we will discuss these properties one by one. 1. 6. 1 Relative We have learnt in Section 1. 4. 3 that the vapour pressure of a solvent in Lowering of solution is less than that of the pure solvent. Raoult established that the Vapour lowering of vapour pressure depends only on the concentration of the Pressure solute particles and it is independent of their identity. The equation(1. 20) given in Section 1. 4. 3 establishes a relation between vapour pressure of the solution, mole fraction and vapour pressure of the solvent, i. e., p = x p 0(1. 22) 1 1 1 The reduction in the vapour pressure of solvent(Dp) is given as: 1 Dp = p 0 p = p 0 p 0 x 1 1 1 1 1 1 = p 0(1 x)(1. 23) 1 1 Knowing that x = 1 x, equation(1. 23) reduces to 2 1 Dp = x p 0(1. 24) 1 2 1 In a solution containing several non - volatile solutes, the lowering of the vapour pressure depends on the sum of the mole fraction of different solutes. Equation(1. 24) can be written as p p0 p 1 = 1 1 = x(1. 25) p0 p0 2 1 1 15 Solutions Reprint 2025 - 26 The expression on the left hand side of the equation as mentioned earlier is called relative lowering of vapour pressure and is equal to the mole fraction of the solute. The above equation can be written as: p 1 0 p0 p 1 = n n 2 n since x 2 n n 2 n(1. 26) 1 1 2 1 2 Here n and n are the number of moles of solvent and solute 1 2 respectively present in the solution. For dilute solutions n < < n, 2 1 hence neglecting n in the denominator we have 2 p0 p n 1 1 = 2(1. 27) p0 n 1 1 p0 - p w × M or 1 1 = 2 1(1. 28) p0 M × w 1 2 1 Here w and w are the masses and M and M are the molar masses 1 2 1 2 of the solvent and solute respectively. From this equation(1. 28), knowing all other quantities, the molar mass of solute(M) can be calculated. 2 Example 11111. 66666 The vapour pressure of pure benzene at a certain temperature is 0. 850 bar. A non - volatile, non - electrolyte solid weighing 0. 5 g when added to 39. 0 g of benzene(molar mass 78 g mol - 1). Vapour pressure of the solution, then, is 0. 845 bar. What is the molar mass of the solid substance? Solution The various quantities known to us are as follows: p 0 = 0. 850 bar; p = 0. 845 bar; M = 78 g mol 1; w = 0. 5 g; w = 39 g 1 1 2 1 Substituting these values in equation(2. 28), we get 0. 850 bar 0. 845 bar 0. 5 g × 78 g mol 1 = 0. 850 bar M × 39 g 2 Therefore, M = 170 g mol 1 2 1. 6. 2 Elevation of The vapour pressure of a liquid increases with increase of Boilingpoint temperature. It boils at the temperature at which its vapour pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure. For example, water boils at 373. 15 K(100 ° C) because at this temperature the vapour pressure of water is 1. 013 bar(1 atmosphere). We have also learnt in the last section that vapour pressure of the solvent decreases in the presence of non - volatile solute. Fig. 1. 7 depicts the variation of vapour pressure of the pure solvent and solution as a function of temperature. For example, the vapour pressure of an aqueous solution of sucrose is less than 1. 013 bar at 373. 15 K. In order to make this solution boil, its vapour pressure must be increased to 1. 013 bar by raising the temperature above the boiling temperature of the pure solvent(water). Thus, the boiling point of a solution is Chemistry 16 Reprint 2025 - 26 always higher than that of the boiling point of the pure solvent in which the solution is prepared 1. 013 bar as shown in Fig. 1. 7. Similar to lowering of vapour or pressure, the elevation of boiling point also depends on the number of solute molecules rather than their nature. A solution of 1 mol of sucrose in 1000 g of water boils at 373. 52 K at one atmospheric pressure. Let T0 be the boiling point of pure solvent and b T be the boiling point of solution. The increase in b the boiling point T T T0 is known as b b b elevation of boiling point. Experiments have shown that for dilute Fig. 1. 7: The vapour pressure curve for solutions the elevation of boiling point(DT) is solution lies below the curve for pure b directly proportional to the molal concentration of water. The diagram shows that DT denotes the elevation of boiling b the solute in a solution. Thus point of a solvent in solution. DT(cid: 181) m(1. 29) b or DT = K m(1. 30) b b Here m(molality) is the number of moles of solute dissolved in 1 kg of solvent and the constant of proportionality, K is called Boiling Point b Elevation Constant or Molal Elevation Constant(Ebullioscopic Constant). The unit of K is K kg mol - 1. Values of K for some common b b solvents are given in Table 1. 3. If w gram of solute of molar mass M 2 2 is dissolved in w gram of solvent, then molality, m of the solution is 1 given by the expression: w / M 1000 × w m = 2 2 = 2(1. 31) w / 1000 M × w 1 2 1 Substituting the value of molality in equation(1. 30) we get K × 1000 × w DT = b 2(1. 32) b M × w 2 1 1000 × w × K M = 2 b(1. 33) 2 T × w b 1 Thus, in order to determine M, molar mass of the solute, known 2 mass of solute in a known mass of the solvent is taken and DT is b determined experimentally for a known solvent whose K value is known. B 18 g of glucose, C H O, is dissolved in 1 kg of water in a saucepan. Example 11111. 77777 6 12 6 At what temperature will water boil at 1. 013 bar? K for water is 0. 52 b K kg mol - 1. Moles of glucose = 18 g / 180 g mol 1 = 0. 1 mol Solution Number of kilograms of solvent = 1 kg Thus molality of glucose solution = 0. 1 mol kg - 1 For water, change in boiling point 17 Solutions Reprint 2025 - 26 DT = K × m = 0. 52 K kg mol 1 × 0. 1 mol kg 1 = 0. 052 K b b Since water boils at 373. 15 K at 1. 013 bar pressure, therefore, the boiling point of solution will be 373. 15 + 0. 052 = 373. 202 K. Example 11111. 88888 The boiling point of benzene is 353. 23 K. When 1. 80 g of a non - volatile solute was dissolved in 90 g of benzene, the boiling point is raised to 354. 11 K. Calculate the molar mass of the solute. K for benzene is 2. 53 b K kg mol 1 Solution The elevation(DT) in the boiling point = 354. 11 K 353. 23 K = 0. 88 K b Substituting these values in expression(2. 33) we get 2. 53 K kg mol 1 × 1. 8 g × 1000 g kg 1 M = = 58 g mol 1 2 0. 88 K × 90 g Therefore, molar mass of the solute, M = 58 g mol 1 2 1. 6. 3 Depression The lowering of vapour pressure of a solution causes a lowering of the of Freezing freezing point compared to that of the pure solvent(Fig. 1. 8). We know Point that at the freezing point of a substance, the solid phase is in dynamic equilibrium with the liquid phase. Thus, the freezing point of a substance may be defined as the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the substance in its liquid phase is equal to its vapour pressure in the solid phase. A solution will freeze when its vapour pressure equals the vapour pressure of the pure solid solvent as is clear from Fig. 1. 8. According to Raoult s law, when a non - volatile solid is added to the solvent its vapour pressure decreases and now it would become equal to that of solid solvent at lower temperature. Thus, the freezing point of the solvent decreases. Let T0 be the freezing point of pure solvent f and T be its freezing point when non - volatile f solute is dissolved in it. The decrease in freezing point. Fig. 1. 8: Diagram showing DT, depression of the freezing point o f f a solvent in T T0 T is known as depression in f f f a solution. Freezing point. Similar to elevation of boiling point, depression of freezing point(DT) f for dilute solution(ideal solution) is directly proportional to molality, m of the solution. Thus, DT(cid: 181) m f or DT = K m(1. 34) f f The proportionality constant, K, which depends on the nature of the f solvent is known as Freezing Point Depression Constant or Molal Chemistry 18 Reprint 2025 - 26 Depression Constant or Cryoscopic Constant. The unit of K is K kg f mol - 1. Values of K for some common solvents are listed in Table 1. 3. F If w gram of the solute having molar mass as M, present in w 2 2 1 gram of solvent, produces the depression in freezing point DT of the f solvent then molality of the solute is given by the equation(1. 31). W / M 2 2 m = w / 1000(1. 31) 1 Substituting this value of molality in equation(1. 34) we get: K w / M f 2 2 DT f = w / 1000 1 K × w × 1000 f 2 DT f = M × w(1. 35) 2 1 K × w × 1000 f 2 M 2 = T × w(1. 36) f 1 Thus for determining the molar mass of the solute we should know the quantities w, w, DT, along with the molal freezing point depression 1 2 f constant. The values of K and K, which depend upon the nature of the f b solvent, can be ascertained from the following relations. R × M × T2 1 f K =(1. 37) f 1000 × H fus R × M × T2 1 b K =(1. 38) b 1000 × H vap Here the symbols R and M stand for the gas constant and molar 1 mass of the solvent, respectively and T and T denote the freezing point f b and the boiling point of the pure solvent respectively in kelvin. Further, D H and D H represent the enthalpies for the fusion and vapourisation fus vap of the solvent, respectively.

Calculate 2 6 2(a) the freezing point depression and(b) the freezing point of the solution. Solution Depression in freezing point is related to the molality, therefore, the molality moles of ethylene glycol of the solution with respect to ethylene glycol = mass of water in kilogram 45 g Moles of ethylene glycol = = 0. 73 mol 62 g mol 1 600g Mass of water in kg = = 0. 6 kg 1000g kg 1 0. 73 mol Hence molality of ethylene glycol = = 1. 2 mol kg 1 0. 60 kg Therefore freezing point depression, ÄT = 1. 86 K kg mol 1 × 1. 2 mol kg 1 = 2. 2 K f Freezing point of the aqueous solution = 273. 15 K 2. 2 K = 270. 95 K Example 11111. 1111100000 1. 00 g of a non - electrolyte solute dissolved in 50 g of benzene lowered the freezing point of benzene by 0. 40 K. The freezing point depression constant of benzene is 5. 12 K kg mol 1. Find the molar mass of the solute. Solution Substituting the values of various terms involved in equation(1. 36) we get, 5. 12 K kg mol 1 × 1. 00 g × 1000 g kg 1 M = = 256 g mol - 1 2 0. 40 × 50 g Thus, molar mass of the solute = 256 g mol - 1 1. 6. 4 Osmosis There are many phenomena which we observe in nature or at home. And Osmotic For example, raw mangoes shrivel when pickled in brine(salt water); Pressure wilted flowers revive when placed in fresh water, blood cells collapse when suspended in saline water, etc. If we look into these processes we find one thing common in all, that is, all these substances are bound by membranes. These membranes can be of animal or vegetable origin and these occur naturally such as pig s bladder or parchment or can be synthetic such as cellophane. These membranes appear to Fig. 1. 9 be continuous sheets or Level of solution films, yet they contain a rises in the thistle funnel due to network of submicroscopic osmosis of solvent. Holes or pores. Small solvent Chemistry 20 Reprint 2025 - 26 molecules, like water, can pass through these holes but the passage of bigger molecules like solute is hindered. Membranes having this kind of properties are known as semipermeable membranes(SPM). Assume that only solvent molecules can pass through these semi - permeable membranes. If this membrane is placed between the solvent and solution as shown in Fig. 1. 9, the solvent molecules will flow through the membrane from pure solvent to the solution. This process of flow of the solvent is called osmosis. The flow will continue till the equilibrium is attained. The flow of the solvent from its side to solution side across a semipermeable membrane can be stopped if some extra pressure is applied on the solution. This pressure that just stops the flow of solvent is called osmotic pressure of the solution. The flow of solvent from dilute solution to the concentrated solution across a semipermeable membrane is due to osmosis. The important point to be kept in mind is that solvent molecules always flow from lower concentration to higher concentration of solution. The osmotic pressure has been found to depend on the concentration of the solution. The osmotic pressure of a solution is the excess pressure that must be applied to a solution to prevent osmosis, i. e., to stop the passage of solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane into the solution. This is illustrated in Fig. 1. 10. Osmotic pressure is a colligative property as it depends on the number of solute molecules and not on their identity. For dilute solutions, it has been found experimentally that osmotic pressure is proportional to the molarity, C of the solution at a given temperature T. Thus: P = C R T(1. 39) Fig. 1. 10: The excess pressure equal to the Here P is the osmotic pressure and R is the osmotic pressure must be applied on gas constant. The solution side to prevent osmosis. P =(n / V) R T(1. 40) 2 Here V is volume of a solution in litres containing n moles of solute. 2 If w grams of solute, of molar mass, M is present in the solution, then 2 2 n = w / M and we can write, 2 2 2 w R T P V = 2(1. 41) M 2 w R T or M = 2(1. 42) 2(cid: 213) V Thus, knowing the quantities w, T, P and V we can calculate the 2 molar mass of the solute. Measurement of osmotic pressure provides another method of determining molar masses of solutes. This method is widely used to determine molar masses of proteins, polymers and other 21 Solutions Reprint 2025 - 26 macromolecules. The osmotic pressure method has the advantage over other methods as pressure measurement is around the room temperature and the molarity of the solution is used instead of molality. As compared to other colligative properties, its magnitude is large even for very dilute solutions. The technique of osmotic pressure for determination of molar mass of solutes is particularly useful for biomolecules as they are generally not stable at higher temperatures and polymers have poor solubility. Two solutions having same osmotic pressure at a given temperature are called isotonic solutions. When such solutions are separated by semipermeable membrane no osmosis occurs between them. For example, the osmotic pressure associated with the fluid inside the blood cell is equivalent to that of 0. 9 %(mass / volume) sodium chloride solution, called normal saline solution and it is safe to inject intravenously. On the other hand, if we place the cells in a solution containing more than 0. 9 %(mass / volume) sodium chloride, water will flow out of the cells and they would shrink. Such a solution is called hypertonic. If the salt concentration is less than 0. 9 %(mass / volume), the solution is said to be hypotonic. In this case, water will flow into the cells if placed in this solution and they would swell. Example 11111. 1111111111 200 cm3 of an aqueous solution of a protein contains 1. 26 g of the protein. The osmotic pressure of such a solution at 300 K is found to be 2. 57 × 10 - 3 bar. Calculate the molar mass of the protein. Solution The various quantities known to us are as follows: P = 2. 57 × 10 3 bar, V = 200 cm3 = 0. 200 litre T = 300 K R = 0. 083 L bar mol - 1 K - 1 Substituting these values in equation(2. 42) we get 1. 26 g × 0. 083 L bar K 1 mol 1 × 300 K M = = 61, 022 g mol - 1 2 2. 57 × 10 3bar × 0. 200 L The phenomena mentioned in the beginning of this section can be explained on the basis of osmosis. A raw mango placed in concentrated salt solution loses water via osmosis and shrivel into pickle. Wilted flowers revive when placed in fresh water. A carrot that has become limp because of water loss into the atmosphere can be placed into the water making it firm once again. Water will move into its cells through osmosis. When placed in water containing less than 0. 9 %(mass / volume) salt, blood cells swell due to flow of water in them by osmosis. People taking a lot of salt or salty food experience water retention in tissue cells and intercellular spaces because of osmosis. The resulting Chemistry 22 Reprint 2025 - 26 puffiness or swelling is called edema. Water movement from soil into plant roots and subsequently into upper portion of the plant is partly due to osmosis. The preservation of meat by salting and of fruits by adding sugar protects against bacterial action. Through the process of osmosis, a bacterium on salted meat or candid fruit loses water, shrivels and dies. 1. 6. 5 Reverse The direction of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure larger than the Osmosis and osmotic pressure is applied to the solution side. That is, now the Water pure solvent flows out of the solution through the semi permeable Purification membrane. This phenomenon is called reverse osmosis and is of great practical utility. Reverse osmosis is used in desalination of sea water. A schematic set up for the process is shown in Fig. 1. 11. When pressure more than osmotic pressure is applied, pure water is squeezed out of the sea water through the membrane. A variety of polymer membranes are available for this purpose. The pressure required for the reverse osmosis is quite high. A workable porous membrane is a film of cellulose acetate placed over a suitable support. Cellulose acetate is permeable to water but impermeable to impurities and ions present in sea water. These days many countries use Fig. 1. 11: Reverse osmosis occurs when a pressure larger than the osmotic desalination plants to meet their potable water pressure is applied to the solution.

For example, if we dissolve one mole of Kcl(74. 5 g) in water, we expect one mole each of K + and Cl ions to be released in Mases the solution. If this happens, there would be two moles of particles in the solution. If we ignore interionic attractions, one mole of Kcl in one kg of water would be expected to increase the boiling point by 2 × 0. 52 K = 1. 04 K. Now if we did not know about the degree of 23 Solutions Reprint 2025 - 26 dissociation, we could be led to conclude that the mass of 2 mol particles is 74. 5 g and the mass of one mole of Kcl would be 37. 25 g. This brings into light the rule that, when there is dissociation of solute into ions, the experimentally determined molar mass is always lower than the true value. 2 CH COOH(CH COOH) Molecules of ethanoic acid(acetic acid) dimerise in 3 3 2 benzene due to hydrogen bonding. This normally happens in solvents of low dielectric constant. In this case the number of particles is reduced due to dimerisation. Association of molecules is depicted as follows: It can be undoubtedly stated here that if all the molecules of ethanoic acid associate in benzene, then DT or DT for ethanoic acid will be half b f of the normal value. The molar mass calculated on the basis of this DT b or DT will, therefore, be twice the expected value. Such a molar mass f that is either lower or higher than the expected or normal value is called as abnormal molar mass. In 1880 van t Hoff introduced a factor i, known as the van t Hoff factor, to account for the extent of dissociation or association. This factor i is defined as: Normal molar mass i Abnormal molar mass Observed colligative property Calculated colligative property Total number of moles of particles after association / dissociation i Number of moles of particles before association / dissociation Here abnormal molar mass is the experimentally determined molar mass and calculated colligative properties are obtained by assuming that the non - volatile solute is neither associated nor dissociated. In case of association, value of i is less than unity while for dissociation it is greater than unity. For example, the value of i for aqueous Kcl solution is close to 2, while the value for ethanoic acid in benzene is nearly 0. 5.

The given quantities are: w = 2 g; K = 4. 9 K kg mol 1; w = 25 g, Solution 2 f 1 D T = 1. 62 K f Substituting these values in equation(1. 36) we get: 4. 9 K kg mol 1 × 2 g × 1000 g kg 1 M = = 241. 98 g mol 1 2 25 g × 1. 62 K Thus, experimental molar mass of benzoic acid in benzene is = 241. 98 g mol 1 Now consider the following equilibrium for the acid: 2 C H COOH(C H COOH) 6 5 6 5 2 If x represents the degree of association of the solute then we would have(1 x) mol of benzoic acid left in unassociated form and x correspondingly as associated moles of benzoic acid at equilibrium. 2 Therefore, total number of moles of particles at equilibrium is: x x 1 x 1 2 2 Thus, total number of moles of particles at equilibrium equals van t Hoff factor i.

Solutions are classified as solid, liquid and gaseous solutions. The concentration of a solution is expressed in terms of mole fraction, molarity, molality and in percentages. The dissolution of a gas in a liquid is governed by Henry s law, according to which, at a given temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas. The vapour pressure of the solvent is lowered by the presence of a non - volatile solute in the solution and this lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent is governed by Raoult s law, according to which the relative lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent over a solution is equal to the mole fraction of a non - volatile solute present in the solution. However, in a binary liquid solution, if both the components of the solution are volatile then another form of Raoult s law is used. Mathematically, this form of the Raoult s law is stated as: p p0x p0x. Solutions which obey Raoult s law over the entire range total 1 1 2 2 of concentration are called ideal solutions. Two types of deviations from Raoult s law, called positive and negative deviations are observed. Azeotropes arise due to very large deviations from Raoult s law. The properties of solutions which depend on the number of solute particles and are independent of their chemical identity are called colligative properties. These are lowering of vapour pressure, elevation of boiling point, depression of freezing point and osmotic pressure. The process of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure higher than the osmotic pressure is applied to the solution. Colligative properties have been used to determine the molar mass of solutes. Solutes which dissociate in solution exhibit molar mass lower than the actual molar mass and those which associate show higher molar mass than their actual values. Quantitatively, the extent to which a solute is dissociated or associated can be expressed by van t Hoff factor i.

In this device the Gibbs energy of the spontaneous\nredox reaction is converted into electrical work which may be used for\nrunning a motor or other electrical gadgets like heater, fan,\ngeyser, etc.\nDaniell cell discussed earlier is one such cell in which the following\nredox reaction occurs.\nZn(s) + Cu2+(aq) fi Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s)\nThis reaction is a combination of two half reactions whose addition\ngives the overall cell reaction:\n(i) Cu2+ + 2e– fi Cu(s) (reduction half reaction) (2.2)\n(ii) Zn(s) fi Zn2+ + 2e– (oxidation half reaction) (2.3)\nThese reactions occur in two different portions of the Daniell cell.\nThe reduction half reaction occurs on the copper electrode while the\noxidation half reaction occurs on the zinc electrode. These two portions\nof the cell are also called half-cells or redox couples. The copper\nelectrode may be called the reduction half cell and the zinc electrode,\nthe oxidation half-cell.\nWe can construct innumerable number of galvanic cells on the pattern\nof Daniell cell by taking combinations of different half-cells. Each half-\ncell consists of a metallic electrode dipped into an electrolyte. The two\nhalf-cells are connected by a metallic wire through a voltmeter and a\nswitch externally. The electrolytes of the two half-cells are connected\ninternally through a salt bridge as shown in Fig. 2.1. Sometimes, both\nthe electrodes dip in the same electrolyte solution and in such cases we\ndo not require a salt bridge.\nAt each electrode-electrolyte interface there is a tendency of metal\nions from the solution to deposit on the metal electrode trying to make\nit positively charged. At the same time, metal atoms of the electrode\nhave a tendency to go into the solution as ions and leave behind the\nelectrons at the electrode trying to make it negatively charged. At\nequilibrium, there is a separation of charges and depending on the\ntendencies of the two opposing reactions, the electrode may be positively\nor negatively charged with respect to the solution. A potential difference\ndevelops between the electrode and the electrolyte which is called\nelectrode potential. When the concentrations of all the species involved\nin a half-cell is unity then the electrode potential is known as standard\nelectrode potential. According to IUPAC convention, standard\nreduction potentials are now called standard electrode potentials. In a\ngalvanic cell, the half-cell in which oxidation takes place is called anode\nand it has a negative potential with respect to the solution. The other\nhalf-cell in which reduction takes place is called cathode and it has a\npositive potential with respect to the solution. Thus, there exists a\npotential difference between the two electrodes and as soon as the\nswitch is in the on position the electrons flow from negative electrode\nto positive electrode. The direction of current flow is opposite to that of\nelectron flow.\n33 Electrochemistry\nReprint 2025-26\nThe potential difference between the two electrodes of a galvanic\ncell is called the cell potential and is measured in volts. The cell\npotential is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction\npotentials) of the cathode and anode. It is called the cell electromotive\nforce (emf) of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell. It\nis now an accepted convention that we keep the anode on the left and\nthe cathode on the right while representing the galvanic cell. A galvanic\ncell is generally represented by putting a vertical line between metal\nand electrolyte solution and putting a double vertical line between\nthe two electrolytes connected by a salt bridge. Under this convention\nthe emf of the cell is positive and is given by the potential of the half-\ncell on the right hand side minus the potential of the half-cell on the\nleft hand side i.e.,\nE = E – E\ncell right left\nThis is illustrated by the following example:\nCell reaction:\nCu(s) + 2Ag+(aq) (cid:190)fi Cu2+(aq) + 2 Ag(s) (2.4)\nHalf-cell reactions:\nCathode (reduction): 2Ag+(aq) + 2e– fi 2Ag(s) (2.5)\nAnode (oxidation): Cu(s) fi Cu2+(aq) + 2e– (2.6)\nIt can be seen that the sum of (3.5) and (3.6) leads to overall reaction\n(2.4) in the cell and that silver electrode acts as a cathode and copper\nelectrode acts as an anode. The cell can be represented as:\nCu(s)|Cu2+(aq)||Ag+(aq)|Ag(s)\nand we have E = E – E = E – E (2.7)\ncell right left Ag+œAg Cu2+œCu\n2.2.1 The potential of individual half-cell cannot be measured. We can\nMeasurement measure only the difference between the two half-cell potentials that\nof Electrode gives the emf of the cell. If we arbitrarily choose the potential of one\nPotential electrode (half-cell) then that of the other can be determined with respect\nto this. According to convention, a half-cell\ncalled standard hydrogen electrode (Fig.3.3)\nrepresented by Pt(s)œ H (g)œ H+(aq), is assigned\n2\na zero potential at all temperatures\ncorresponding to the reaction\n1\nH+ (aq) + e– fi H (g)\n2 2\nThe standard hydrogen electrode consists\nof a platinum electrode coated with platinum\nblack. The electrode is dipped in an acidic\nsolution and pure hydrogen gas is bubbled\nthrough it. The concentration of both the\nreduced and oxidised forms of hydrogen is\nmaintained at unity (Fig. 2.3). This implies\nthat the pressure of hydrogen gas is one bar\nand the concentration of hydrogen ion in the\nFig. 2.3: Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE). solution is one molar.\nChemistry 34\nReprint 2025-26\nAt 298 K the emf of the cell, standard hydrogen electrode (cid:231)(cid:231)second\nhalf-cell constructed by taking standard hydrogen electrode as anode\n(reference half-cell) and the other half-cell as cathode, gives the reduction\npotential of the other half-cell. If the concentrations of the oxidised and\nthe reduced forms of the species in the right hand half-cell are unity,\nthen the cell potential is equal to standard electrode potential, Eo of\nR\nthe given half-cell.\nEo = Eo – Eo\nR L\nAs Eo for standard hydrogen electrode is zero.\nL\nEo = Eo – 0 = Eo\nR R\nThe measured emf of the cell:\nPt(s) (cid:231) H (g, 1 bar) (cid:231) H+ (aq, 1 M) (cid:231)(cid:231) Cu2+ (aq, 1 M) œ Cu\n2\nis 0.34 V and it is also the value for the standard electrode potential\nof the half-cell corresponding to the reaction:\nCu2+ (aq, 1M) + 2 e– fi Cu(s)\nSimilarly, the measured emf of the cell:\nPt(s) (cid:231) H (g, 1 bar) (cid:231) H+ (aq, 1 M) (cid:231)(cid:231) Zn2+ (aq, 1M) (cid:231) Zn\n2\nis -0.76 V corresponding to the standard electrode potential of the\nhalf-cell reaction:\nZn2+ (aq, 1 M) + 2e– fi Zn(s)\nThe positive value of the standard electrode potential in the first\ncase indicates that Cu2+ ions get reduced more easily than H+ ions. The\nreverse process cannot occur, that is, hydrogen ions cannot oxidise Cu\n(or alternatively we can say that hydrogen gas can reduce copper ion)\nunder the standard conditions described above. Thus, Cu does not\ndissolve in HCl. In nitric acid it is oxidised by nitrate ion and not by\nhydrogen ion. The negative value of the standard electrode potential\nin the second case indicates that hydrogen ions can oxidise zinc (or\nzinc can reduce hydrogen ions).\nIn view of this convention, the half reaction for the Daniell cell in\nFig. 2.1 can be written as:\nLeft electrode: Zn(s) fi Zn2+ (aq, 1 M) + 2 e–\nRight electrode: Cu2+ (aq, 1 M) + 2 e– fi Cu(s)\nThe overall reaction of the cell is the sum of above two reactions\nand we obtain the equation:\nZn(s) + Cu2+ (aq) fi Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s)\nemf of the cell = Eo = Eo – Eo\ncell R L\n= 0.34V – (–0.76)V = 1.10 V\nSometimes metals like platinum or gold are used as inert electrodes.\nThey do not participate in the reaction but provide their surface for\noxidation or reduction reactions and for the conduction of electrons.\nFor example, Pt is used in the following half-cells:\nHydrogen electrode: Pt(s)|H (g)| H+(aq)\n2\nWith half-cell reaction: H+ (aq)+ e– fi ½ H (g)\n2\nBromine electrode: Pt(s)|Br (aq)| Br–(aq)\n2\n35 Electrochemistry\nReprint 2025-26\nWith half-cell reaction: ½ Br (aq) + e– fi Br–(aq)\n2\nThe standard electrode potentials are very important and we can\nextract a lot of useful information from them. The values of standard\nelectrode potentials for some selected half-cell reduction reactions are\ngiven in Table 2.1. If the standard electrode potential of an electrode\nis greater than zero then its reduced form is more stable compared to\nhydrogen gas. Similarly, if the standard electrode potential is negative\nthen hydrogen gas is more stable than the reduced form of the species.\nIt can be seen that the standard electrode potential for fluorine is the\nhighest in the Table indicating that fluorine gas (F ) has the maximum\n2\ntendency to get reduced to fluoride ions (F–) and therefore fluorine\ngas is the strongest oxidising agent and fluoride ion is the weakest\nreducing agent. Lithium has the lowest electrode potential indicating\nthat lithium ion is the weakest oxidising agent while lithium metal is\nthe most powerful reducing agent in an aqueous solution. It may be\nseen that as we go from top to bottom in Table 2.1 the standard\nelectrode potential decreases and with this, decreases the oxidising\npower of the species on the left and increases the reducing power of\nthe species on the right hand side of the reaction.

It can be\nmeasured with the help of a Wheatstone bridge with which you are\nfamiliar from your study of physics.

That is,\nl l\nR (cid:181) or R = r (2.17)\nA A\nThe constant of proportionality, r (Greek, rho), is called resistivity\n(specific resistance). Its SI units are ohm metre (W m) and quite often\nits submultiple, ohm centimetre (W cm) is also used. IUPAC recommends\nthe use of the term resistivity over specific resistance and hence in the\nrest of the book we shall use the term resistivity. Physically, the resistivity\nfor a substance is its resistance when it is one metre long and its area\nof cross section is one m2. It can be seen that:\n1 W m = 100 W cm or 1 W cm = 0.01 W m\nThe inverse of resistance, R, is called conductance, G, and we have\nthe relation:\n1 A A\nG = = =k (2.18)\nR ρl l\nThe SI unit of conductance is siemens, represented by the symbol\n‘S’ and is equal to ohm–1 (also known as mho) or W–1.

IUPAC has recommended the use of term\nconductivity over specific conductance and hence we shall use the term\nconductivity in the rest of the book. The SI units of conductivity are\nS m–1 but quite often, k is expressed in S cm–1. Conductivity of a\nmaterial in S m–1 is its conductance when it is 1 m long and its area\nof cross section is 1 m2. It may be noted that 1 S cm–1 = 100 S m–1.\n41 Electrochemistry\nReprint 2025-26\nTable 2.2: The values of Conductivity of some Selected\nMaterials at 298.15 K\nMaterial Conductivity/ Material Conductivity/\nS m–1 S m–1\nConductors Aqueous Solutions\nSodium 2.1×103 Pure water 3.5×10–5\nCopper 5.9×103 0.1 M HCl 3.91\nSilver 6.2×103 0.01M KCl 0.14\nGold 4.5×103 0.01M NaCl 0.12\nIron 1.0×103 0.1 M HAc 0.047\nGraphite 1.2×10 0.01M HAc 0.016\nInsulators Semiconductors\nGlass 1.0×10–16 CuO 1×10–7\nTeflon 1.0×10–18 Si 1.5×10–2\nGe 2.0\nIt can be seen from Table 2.2 that the magnitude of conductivity\nvaries a great deal and depends on the nature of the material. It also\ndepends on the temperature and pressure at which the measurements\nare made. Materials are classified into conductors, insulators and\nsemiconductors depending on the magnitude of their conductivity. Metals\nand their alloys have very large conductivity and are known as conductors.\nCertain non-metals like carbon-black, graphite and some organic\npolymers* are also electronically conducting. Substances like glass,\nceramics, etc., having very low conductivity are known as insulators.\nSubstances like silicon, doped silicon and gallium arsenide having\nconductivity between conductors and insulators are called\nsemiconductors and are important electronic materials. Certain materials\ncalled superconductors by definition have zero resistivity or infinite\nconductivity. Earlier, only metals and their alloys at very low temperatures\n(0 to 15 K) were known to behave as superconductors, but nowadays a\nnumber of ceramic materials and mixed oxides are also known to show\nsuperconductivity at temperatures as high as 150 K.\nElectrical conductance through metals is called metallic or electronic\nconductance and is due to the movement of electrons. The electronic\nconductance depends on\n(i) the nature and structure of the metal\n(ii) the number of valence electrons per atom\n(iii) temperature (it decreases with increase of temperature).\n* Electronically conducting polymers – In 1977 MacDiarmid, Heeger and Shirakawa discovered that acetylene gas can be\npolymerised to produce a polymer, polyacetylene when exposed to vapours of iodine acquires metallic lustre and\nconductivity. Since then several organic conducting polymers have been made such as polyaniline, polypyrrole and\npolythiophene. These organic polymers which have properties like metals, being composed wholly of elements like\ncarbon, hydrogen and occasionally nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur, are much lighter than normal metals and can be used\nfor making light-weight batteries. Besides, they have the mechanical properties of polymers such as flexibility so that\none can make electronic devices such as transistors that can bend like a sheet of plastic. For the discovery of conducting\npolymers, MacDiarmid, Heeger and Shirakawa were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the year 2000.\nChemistry 42\nReprint 2025-26\nAs the electrons enter at one end and go out through the other end,\nthe composition of the metallic conductor remains unchanged. The\nmechanism of conductance through semiconductors is more complex.\nWe already know that even very pure water has small amounts of\nhydrogen and hydroxyl ions (~10–7M) which lend it very low conductivity\n(3.5 × 10–5 S m–1). When electrolytes are dissolved in water, they furnish\ntheir own ions in the solution hence its conductivity also increases. The\nconductance of electricity by ions present in the solutions is called\nelectrolytic or ionic conductance. The conductivity of electrolytic (ionic)\nsolutions depends on:\n(i) the nature of the electrolyte added\n(ii) size of the ions produced and their solvation\n(iii) the nature of the solvent and its viscosity\n(iv) concentration of the electrolyte\n(v) temperature (it increases with the increase of temperature).\nPassage of direct current through ionic solution over a prolonged\nperiod can lead to change in its composition due to electrochemical\nreactions (Section 2.4.1).\n2.4.1 Measurement We know that accurate measurement of an unknown resistance can be\nof the performed on a Wheatstone bridge. However, for measuring the resistance\nConductivity of an ionic solution we face two problems. Firstly, passing direct current\nof Ionic (DC) changes the composition of the solution. Secondly, a solution cannot\nSolutions be connected to the bridge like a metallic wire or other solid conductor.\nThe first difficulty is resolved by using an alternating current (AC) source\nof power. The second problem is solved by using a specially designed\nvessel called conductivity cell. It is available in several designs and two\nsimple ones are shown in Fig. 2.4.\nConnecting\nConnecting wires\nwires\nPlatinized Pt\nFig. 2.4 electrodes\nTwo different types of\nconductivity cells. Platinized Pt electrode Platinized Pt electrode\nBasically it consists of two platinum electrodes coated with platinum\nblack (finely divided metallic Pt is deposited on the electrodes\nelectrochemically). These have area of cross section equal to ‘A’ and are\nseparated by distance ‘l’. Therefore, solution confined between these\nelectrodes is a column of length l and area of cross section A. The\nresistance of such a column of solution is then given by the equation:\nl l\nR = r = (2.17)\nA A\n43 Electrochemistry\nReprint 2025-26\nThe quantity l/A is called cell constant denoted by the symbol, G*.\nIt depends on the distance between the electrodes and their area of\ncross-section and has the dimension of length–1 and can be calculated\nif we know l and A. Measurement of l and A is not only inconvenient\nbut also unreliable. The cell constant is usually determined by measuring\nthe resistance of the cell containing a solution whose conductivity is\nalready known. For this purpose, we generally use KCl solutions whose\nconductivity is known accurately at various concentrations (Table 2.3)\nand at different temperatures. The cell constant, G*, is then given by\nthe equation:\nl\nG* = = R k (2.18)\nA\nTable 2.3: Conductivity and Molar conductivity of KCl solutions\nat 298.15K\nConcentration/Molarity Conductivity Molar Conductivity\nmol L–1 mol m–3 S cm–1 S m–1 S cm2mol–1 S m2 mol–1\n1.000 1000 0.1113 11.13 111.3 111.3×10–4\n0.100 100.0 0.0129 1.29 129.0 129.0×10–4\n0.010 10.00 0.00141 0.141 141.0 141.0×10–4\nOnce the cell constant is determined, we can\nuse it for measuring the resistance or conductivity\nof any solution. The set up for the measurement\nof the resistance is shown in Fig.2.5.\nIt consists of two resistances R and R , a\n3 4\nvariable resistance R and the conductivity cell\n1\nhaving the unknown resistance R . The\n2\nWheatstone bridge is fed by an oscillator O (a\nsource of a.c. power in the audio frequency range\n550 to 5000 cycles per second). P is a suitable\ndetector (a headphone or other electronic device)\nand the bridge is balanced when no current passes\nthrough the detector. Under these conditions:\nFig. 2.5: Arrangement for measurement of R R\nUnknown resistance R = 1 4 (2.19)\nresistance of a solution of an 2 R\nelectrolyte. 3\nThese days, inexpensive conductivity meters are\navailable which can directly read the conductance or resistance of the\nsolution in the conductivity cell.

It, therefore, becomes\nnecessary to define a physically more meaningful quantity called molar\nconductivity denoted by the symbol L (Greek, lambda). It is related\nm\nto the conductivity of the solution by the equation:\n\nMolar conductivity = L = (2.21)\nm c\nIn the above equation, if k is expressed in S m–1 and the concentration,\nc in mol m–3 then the units of L are in S m2 mol–1. It may be noted that:\nm\n1 mol m–3 = 1000(L/m3) × molarity (mol/L), and hence\n (S cm1)\nL (S cm2 mol–1) =\nm 1000 L m3 × molarity (mol L1)\nIf we use S cm–1 as the units for k and mol cm–3, the units of\nconcentration, then the units for L are S cm2 mol–1.

Therefore,\nκA\nΛ = =κ\nm l\nSince l = 1 and A = V ( volume containing 1 mole of electrolyte)\nL = k V (2.22)\nm\nMolar conductivity increases with\ndecrease in concentration. This is\nbecause the total volume, V, of solution\ncontaining one mole of electrolyte also\nincreases. It has been found that decrease\nin k on dilution of a solution is more\nthan compensated by increase in its\nvolume. Physically, it means that at a\ngiven concentration, L can be defined\nm\nas the conductance of the electrolytic\nsolution kept between the electrodes of a\nconductivity cell at unit distance but\nhaving area of cross section large enough\nto accommodate sufficient volume of\nsolution that contains one mole of the\nelectrolyte. When concentration\napproaches zero, the molar conductivity\nis known as limiting molar\nconductivity and is represented by the\nFig. 2.6: Molar conductivity versus c½ for acetic\nacid (weak electrolyte) and potassium symbol L(cid:176) m . The variation in L m with\nchloride (strong electrolyte) in aqueous concentration is different (Fig. 2.6) for\nsolutions. strong and weak electrolytes.\nStrongElectrolytes\nFor strong electrolytes, L increases slowly with dilution and can be\nm\nrepresented by the equation:\nL = L(cid:176) – A c ½ (2.23)\nm m\nIt can be seen that if we plot (Fig. 2.6) L against\nm\nc1/2, we obtain a straight line with intercept equal to L(cid:176) and slope\nm\nequal to ‘–A’. The value of the constant ‘A’ for a given solvent and\ntemperature depends on the type of electrolyte i.e., the charges on the\ncation and anion produced on the dissociation of the electrolyte in the\nsolution. Thus, NaCl, CaCl , MgSO are known as 1-1, 2-1 and 2-2\n2 4\nelectrolytes respectively.

He noted that the difference in m of\nthe electrolytes NaX and KX for any X is nearly constant. For example\nat 298 K:\nL(cid:176)\nm (KCl) –\nL(cid:176)\nm (NaCl) =\nL(cid:176)\nm (KBr) –\nL(cid:176)\nm (NaBr)\n= L(cid:176)\nm (KI)\n– L(cid:176)\nm (NaI)\n≃ 23.4 S cm2 mol–1\nand similarly it was found that\nL(cid:176)\nm (NaBr)\n– L(cid:176)\nm (NaCl)\n= L(cid:176)\nm (KBr)\n– L(cid:176)\nm (KCl)\n≃ 1.8 S cm2 mol–1\nOn the basis of the above observations he enunciated Kohlrausch\nlaw of independent migration of ions.

One of the simplest electrolytic\nEEEEEllllleeeeeccccctttttrrrrrooooolllllyyyyysssssiiiiisssss\ncell consists of two copper strips dipping in an aqueous solution of\ncopper sulphate. If a DC voltage is applied to the two electrodes, then\nCu 2+ ions discharge at the cathode (negatively charged) and the following\nreaction takes place:\nCu2+(aq) + 2e– fi Cu (s) (2.28)\nCopper metal is deposited on the cathode. At the anode, copper is\nconverted into Cu2+ ions by the reaction:\nCu(s) fi Cu2+(s) + 2e– (2.29)\nThus copper is dissolved (oxidised) at anode and deposited\n(reduced) at cathode. This is the basis for an industrial process in\nwhich impure copper is converted into copper of high purity. The\nimpure copper is made an anode that dissolves on passing current\nand pure copper is deposited at the cathode. Many metals like Na, Mg,\nAl, etc. are produced on large scale by electrochemical reduction of\ntheir respective cations where no suitable chemical reducing agents\nare available for this purpose.\nSodium and magnesium metals are produced by the electrolysis of\ntheir fused chlorides and aluminium is produced by electrolysis of\naluminium oxide in presence of cryolite.\nQuantitative Aspects of Electrolysis\nMichael Faraday was the first scientist who described the quantitative\naspects of electrolysis. Now Faraday’s laws also flow from what has\nbeen discussed earlier.\nFaraday’s Laws of Electrolysis\nAfter his extensive investigations on electrolysis of solutions and melts\nof electrolytes, Faraday published his results during 1833-34 in the\nform of the following well known Faraday’s two laws of electrolysis:\n(i) First Law: The amount of chemical reaction which occurs at any\nelectrode during electrolysis by a current is proportional to the\nquantity of electricity passed through the electrolyte (solution or\nmelt).\n(ii) Second Law: The amounts of different substances liberated by the\nsame quantity of electricity passing through the electrolytic solution\nare proportional to their chemical equivalent weights (Atomic Mass\nof Metal ÷ Number of electrons required to reduce the cation).\n51 Electrochemistry\nReprint 2025-26\nThere were no constant current sources available during Faraday’s\ntimes. The general practice was to put a coulometer (a standard electrolytic\ncell) for determining the quantity of electricity passed from the amount\nof metal (generally silver or copper) deposited or consumed. However,\ncoulometers are now obsolete and we now have constant current (I)\nsources available and the quantity of electricity Q, passed is given by\nQ = It\nQ is in coloumbs when I is in ampere and t is in second.\nThe amount of electricity (or charge) required for oxidation or\nreduction depends on the stoichiometry of the electrode reaction. For\nexample, in the reaction:\nAg +(aq) + e– fi Ag(s) (2.30)\nOne mole of the electron is required for the reduction of one mole\nof silver ions.\nWe know that charge on one electron is equal to 1.6021 × 10–19C.\nTherefore, the charge on one mole of electrons is equal to:\nN ×1.6021×10–19 C = 6.02×1023mol–1×1.6021×10–19\nA\nC = 96487 C mol–1\nThis quantity of electricity is called Faraday and is represented by\nthe symbol F.\nFor approximate calculations we use 1F ≃ 96500 C mol–1.\nFor the electrode reactions:\nMg2+(l) + 2e– (cid:190)fi Mg(s) (2.31)\nAl3+(l) + 3e– (cid:190)fi Al(s) (2.32)\nIt is obvious that one mole of Mg2+ and Al3+ require 2 mol of electrons\n(2F) and 3 mol of electrons (3F) respectively. The charge passed through\nthe electrolytic cell during electrolysis is equal to the product of current\nin amperes and time in seconds. In commercial production of metals,\ncurrent as high as 50,000 amperes are used that amounts to about\n0.518 F per second.\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 22222.....1111100000 A solution of CuSO is electrolysed for 10 minutes with a current of\n4\n1.5 amperes.

If the electrode is\ninert (e.g., platinum or gold), it does not participate in the chemical\nreaction and acts only as source or sink for electrons. On the other\nhand, if the electrode is reactive, it participates in the electrode reaction.\nThus, the products of electrolysis may be different for reactive and inert\nChemistry 52\nReprint 2025-26\nelectrodes.The products of electrolysis depend on the different oxidising\nand reducing species present in the electrolytic cell and their standard\nelectrode potentials. Moreover, some of the electrochemical processes\nalthough feasible, are so slow kinetically that at lower voltages these do\nnot seem to take place and extra potential (called overpotential) has to\nbe applied, which makes such process more difficult to occur.\nFor example, if we use molten NaCl, the products of electrolysis are\nsodium metal and Cl gas. Here we have only one cation (Na+) which is\n2\nreduced at the cathode (Na+ + e– fi Na) and one anion (Cl–) which is\noxidised at the anode (Cl– fi ½Cl + e– ) . During the electrolysis of aqueous\n2\nsodium chloride solution, the products are NaOH, Cl and H . In this\n2 2\ncase besides Na+ and Cl– ions we also have H+ and OH– ions along with\nthe solvent molecules, H O.\n2\nAt the cathode there is competition between the following reduction\nreactions:\nNa+ (aq) + e– fi Na (s) Eo = – 2.71 V\n(cell)\nH+ (aq) + e– fi ½ H (g) Eo = 0.00 V\n2 (cell)\nThe reaction with higher value of\nEo\nis preferred and therefore, the\nreaction at the cathode during electrolysis is:\nH+ (aq) + e– fi ½ H (g) (2.33)\n2\nbut H+ (aq) is produced by the dissociation of H O, i.e.,\n2\nH O (l) fi H+ (aq) + OH– (aq) (2.34)\n2\nTherefore, the net reaction at the cathode may be written as the sum\nof (2.33) and (2.34) and we have\nH O (l) + e– fi ½H (g) + OH– (2.35)\n2 2\nAt the anode the following oxidation reactions are possible:\nCl– (aq) fi ½ Cl (g) + e– Eo = 1.36 V (2.36)\n2\n(cell)\n2H O(l) fi O (g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e– Eo = 1.23 V (2.37)\n2 2\n(cell)\nThe reaction at anode with lower value of Eo is preferred and\ntherefore, water should get oxidised in preference to Cl– (aq). However,\non account of overpotential of oxygen, reaction (2.36) is preferred. Thus,\nthe net reactions may be summarised as:\nNaCl (aq) (cid:190)(cid:190) (cid:190) H 2fiO(cid:190) Na+ (aq) + Cl– (aq)\nCathode: H O(l) + e– fi ½ H (g) + OH– (aq)\n2 2\nAnode: Cl– (aq) fi ½ Cl (g) + e–\n2\nNet reaction:\nNaCl(aq) + H O(l) fi Na+(aq) + OH–(aq) + ½H (g) + ½Cl (g)\n2 2 2\nThe standard electrode potentials are replaced by electrode potentials\ngiven by Nernst equation (Eq. 2.8) to take into account the concentration\neffects.

It not only saves\nmoney but also helps in preventing accidents such as a bridge collapse\nor failure of a key component due to corrosion. One of the simplest\nmethods of preventing corrosion is to prevent the surface of the metallic\nobject to come in contact with atmosphere. This can be done by covering\nthe surface with paint or by some chemicals (e.g. bisphenol). Another\nsimple method is to cover the surface by other metals (Sn, Zn, etc.) that\nare inert or react to save the object. An electrochemical method is to\nprovide a sacrificial electrode of another metal (like Mg, Zn, etc.) which\ncorrodes itself but saves the object.\n57 Electrochemistry\nReprint 2025-26\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n2.13 Write the chemistry of recharging the lead storage battery, highlighting\nall the materials that are involved during recharging.\n2.14 Suggest two materials other than hydrogen that can be used as fuels in\nfuel cells.\n2.15 Explain how rusting of iron is envisaged as setting up of an\nelectrochemical cell.\nTTTTThhhhheeeee HHHHHyyyyydddddrrrrrooooogggggeeeeennnnn EEEEEcccccooooonnnnnooooommmmmyyyyy\nAt present the main source of energy that is driving our economy is fossil fuels\nsuch as coal, oil and gas. As more people on the planet aspire to improve their\nstandard of living, their energy requirement will increase. In fact, the per\ncapita consumption of energy used is a measure of development. Of course, it\nis assumed that energy is used for productive purpose and not merely wasted.\nWe are already aware that carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of fossil\nfuels is resulting in the ‘Greenhouse Effect’. This is leading to a rise in the\ntemperature of the Earth’s surface, causing polar ice to melt and ocean levels\nto rise. This will flood low-lying areas along the coast and some island nations\nsuch as Maldives face total submergence. In order to avoid such a catastrope,\nwe need to limit our use of carbonaceous fuels. Hydrogen provides an ideal\nalternative as its combustion results in water only. Hydrogen production must\ncome from splitting water using solar energy. Therefore, hydrogen can be used\nas a renewable and non polluting source of energy. This is the vision of the\nHydrogen Economy. Both the production of hydrogen by electrolysis of water\nand hydrogen combustion in a fuel cell will be important in the future. And\nboth these technologies are based on electrochemical principles.\nSSSSSuuuuummmmmmmmmmaaaaarrrrryyyyy\nAn electrochemical cell consists of two metallic electrodes dipping in electrolytic\nsolution(s). Thus an important component of the electrochemical cell is the ionic\nconductor or electrolyte. Electrochemical cells are of two types. In galvanic cell,\nthe chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction is converted into electrical\nwork, whereas in an electrolytic cell, electrical energy is used to carry out a non-\nspontaneous redox reaction. The standard electrode potential for any electrode\ndipping in an appropriate solution is defined with respect to standard electrode\npotential of hydrogen electrode taken as zero. The standard potential of the cell\ncan be obtained by taking the difference of the standard potentials of cathode and\nanode ( E ( o cell) = Eo cathode – Eo anode). The standard potential of the cells are\nrelated to standard Gibbs energy (DrGo = –nFE ( o cell)) and equilibrium constant\n(DrGo = – RT ln K) of the reaction taking place in the cell. Concentration dependence\nof the potentials of the electrodes and the cells are given by Nernst equation.\nThe conductivity, k, of an electrolytic solution depends on the concentration\nof the electrolyte, nature of solvent and temperature. Molar conductivity, L m, is\ndefined by = k/c where c is the concentration. Conductivity decreases but molar\nconductivity increases with decrease in concentration. It increases slowly with\ndecrease in concentration for strong electrolytes while the increase is very steep\nfor weak electrolytes in very dilute solutions. Kohlrausch found that molar\nconductivity at infinite dilution, for an electrolyte is sum of the contribution of the\nChemistry 58\nReprint 2025-26\nmolar conductivity of the ions in which it dissociates. It is known as law of\nindependent migration of ions and has many applications. Ions conduct electricity\nthrough the solution but oxidation and reduction of the ions take place at the\nelectrodes in an electrochemical cell. Batteries and fuel cells are very useful\nforms of galvanic cell. Corrosion of metals is essentially an electrochemical\nphenomenon.

Reprint 2025 - 26 22222. 11111 Electrochemical We had studied the construction and functioning of Daniell cell Cels(Fig. 2. 1). This cell converts the chemical energy liberated during the redox reaction Zn(s) + Cu2 +(aq) fi Zn2 +(aq) + Cu(s)(2. 1) to electrical energy and has an electrical potential equal to 1. 1 V when concentration of Zn2 + and Cu2 + ions is unity(1 mol dm 3) *. Such a device is called a galvanic or a voltaic cell. If an external opposite potential is applied in the galvanic cell[Fig. 2. 2(a)] and increased slowly, we find that the reaction continues to take place till the opposing voltage reaches the value 1. 1 V[Fig. 2. 2(b)] when, the reaction stops altogether and no current flows through the cell. Any further increase in the external potential again starts the reaction but in the opposite direction[Fig. 2. 2(c)]. It now functions as an electrolytic cell, a device for using electrical energy to carry non - spontaneous chemical reactions. Both types of cells are Fig. 2. 1: Daniell cell having electrodes of zinc and quite important and we shall study some of copper dipping in the solutions of their their salient features in the following pages.

Chemistry 32 Reprint 2025 - 26 22222. 22222 Galvanic Cels As mentioned earlier a galvanic cell is an electrochemical cell that converts the chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction into electrical energy. In this device the Gibbs energy of the spontaneous redox reaction is converted into electrical work which may be used for running a motor or other electrical gadgets like heater, fan, geyser, etc. Daniell cell discussed earlier is one such cell in which the following redox reaction occurs. Zn(s) + Cu2 +(aq) fi Zn2 +(aq) + Cu(s) This reaction is a combination of two half reactions whose addition gives the overall cell reaction:(i) Cu2 + + 2e fi Cu(s)(reduction half reaction)(2. 2)(ii) Zn(s) fi Zn2 + + 2e(oxidation half reaction)(2. 3) These reactions occur in two different portions of the Daniell cell. The reduction half reaction occurs on the copper electrode while the oxidation half reaction occurs on the zinc electrode. These two portions of the cell are also called half - cells or redox couples. The copper electrode may be called the reduction half cell and the zinc electrode, the oxidation half - cell. We can construct innumerable number of galvanic cells on the pattern of Daniell cell by taking combinations of different half - cells. Each half - cell consists of a metallic electrode dipped into an electrolyte. The two half - cells are connected by a metallic wire through a voltmeter and a switch externally. The electrolytes of the two half - cells are connected internally through a salt bridge as shown in Fig. 2. 1. Sometimes, both the electrodes dip in the same electrolyte solution and in such cases we do not require a salt bridge. At each electrode - electrolyte interface there is a tendency of metal ions from the solution to deposit on the metal electrode trying to make it positively charged. At the same time, metal atoms of the electrode have a tendency to go into the solution as ions and leave behind the electrons at the electrode trying to make it negatively charged. At equilibrium, there is a separation of charges and depending on the tendencies of the two opposing reactions, the electrode may be positively or negatively charged with respect to the solution. A potential difference develops between the electrode and the electrolyte which is called electrode potential. When the concentrations of all the species involved in a half - cell is unity then the electrode potential is known as standard electrode potential. According to IUPAC convention, standard reduction potentials are now called standard electrode potentials. In a galvanic cell, the half - cell in which oxidation takes place is called anode and it has a negative potential with respect to the solution. The other half - cell in which reduction takes place is called cathode and it has a positive potential with respect to the solution. Thus, there exists a potential difference between the two electrodes and as soon as the switch is in the on position the electrons flow from negative electrode to positive electrode. The direction of current flow is opposite to that of electron flow. 33 Electrochemistry Reprint 2025 - 26 The potential difference between the two electrodes of a galvanic cell is called the cell potential and is measured in volts. The cell potential is the difference between the electrode potentials(reduction potentials) of the cathode and anode. It is called the cell electromotive force(emf) of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell. It is now an accepted convention that we keep the anode on the left and the cathode on the right while representing the galvanic cell. A galvanic cell is generally represented by putting a vertical line between metal and electrolyte solution and putting a double vertical line between the two electrolytes connected by a salt bridge. Under this convention the emf of the cell is positive and is given by the potential of the half - cell on the right hand side minus the potential of the half - cell on the left hand side i. e., E = E E cell right left This is illustrated by the following example: Cell reaction: Cu(s) + 2Ag +(aq)(cid: 190) fi Cu2 +(aq) + 2 Ag(s)(2. 4) Half - cell reactions: Cathode(reduction): 2Ag +(aq) + 2e fi 2Ag(s)(2. 5) Anode(oxidation): Cu(s) fi Cu2 +(aq) + 2e(2. 6) It can be seen that the sum of(3. 5) and(3. 6) leads to overall reaction(2. 4) in the cell and that silver electrode acts as a cathode and copper electrode acts as an anode. The cell can be represented as: Cu(s) | Cu2 +(aq) | | Ag +(aq) | Ag(s) and we have E = E E = E E(2. 7) cell right left Ag + Œag Cu2 + Œcu 2. 2. 1 The potential of individual half - cell cannot be measured. We can Measurement measure only the difference between the two half - cell potentials that of Electrode gives the emf of the cell. If we arbitrarily choose the potential of one Potential electrode(half - cell) then that of the other can be determined with respect to this. According to convention, a half - cell called standard hydrogen electrode(Fig. 3. 3) represented by Pt(s) œ H(g) œ H +(aq), is assigned 2 a zero potential at all temperatures corresponding to the reaction 1 H +(aq) + e fi H(g) 2 2 The standard hydrogen electrode consists of a platinum electrode coated with platinum black. The electrode is dipped in an acidic solution and pure hydrogen gas is bubbled through it. The concentration of both the reduced and oxidised forms of hydrogen is maintained at unity(Fig. 2. 3). This implies that the pressure of hydrogen gas is one bar and the concentration of hydrogen ion in the Fig. 2. 3: Standard Hydrogen Electrode(SHE). Solution is one molar. Chemistry 34 Reprint 2025 - 26 At 298 K the emf of the cell, standard hydrogen electrode(cid: 231)(cid: 231) second half - cell constructed by taking standard hydrogen electrode as anode(reference half - cell) and the other half - cell as cathode, gives the reduction potential of the other half - cell. If the concentrations of the oxidised and the reduced forms of the species in the right hand half - cell are unity, then the cell potential is equal to standard electrode potential, Eo of R the given half - cell. Eo = Eo Eo R L As Eo for standard hydrogen electrode is zero. L Eo = Eo 0 = Eo R R The measured emf of the cell: Pt(s)(cid: 231) H(g, 1 bar)(cid: 231) H +(aq, 1 M)(cid: 231)(cid: 231) Cu2 +(aq, 1 M) œ Cu 2 is 0. 34 V and it is also the value for the standard electrode potential of the half - cell corresponding to the reaction: Cu2 +(aq, 1M) + 2 e fi Cu(s) Similarly, the measured emf of the cell: Pt(s)(cid: 231) H(g, 1 bar)(cid: 231) H +(aq, 1 M)(cid: 231)(cid: 231) Zn2 +(aq, 1M)(cid: 231) Zn 2 is - 0. 76 V corresponding to the standard electrode potential of the half - cell reaction: Zn2 +(aq, 1 M) + 2e fi Zn(s) The positive value of the standard electrode potential in the first case indicates that Cu2 + ions get reduced more easily than H + ions. The reverse process cannot occur, that is, hydrogen ions cannot oxidise Cu(or alternatively we can say that hydrogen gas can reduce copper ion) under the standard conditions described above. Thus, Cu does not dissolve in Hcl. In nitric acid it is oxidised by nitrate ion and not by hydrogen ion. The negative value of the standard electrode potential in the second case indicates that hydrogen ions can oxidise zinc(or zinc can reduce hydrogen ions). In view of this convention, the half reaction for the Daniell cell in Fig. 2. 1 can be written as: Left electrode: Zn(s) fi Zn2 +(aq, 1 M) + 2 e Right electrode: Cu2 +(aq, 1 M) + 2 e fi Cu(s) The overall reaction of the cell is the sum of above two reactions and we obtain the equation: Zn(s) + Cu2 +(aq) fi Zn2 +(aq) + Cu(s) emf of the cell = Eo = Eo Eo cell R L = 0. 34V(0. 76) V = 1. 10 V Sometimes metals like platinum or gold are used as inert electrodes. They do not participate in the reaction but provide their surface for oxidation or reduction reactions and for the conduction of electrons. For example, Pt is used in the following half - cells: Hydrogen electrode: Pt(s) | H(g) | H +(aq) 2 With half - cell reaction: H +(aq) + e fi 1 2 H(g) 2 Bromine electrode: Pt(s) | Br(aq) | Br(aq) 2 35 Electrochemistry Reprint 2025 - 26 With half - cell reaction: 1 2 Br(aq) + e fi Br(aq) 2 The standard electrode potentials are very important and we can extract a lot of useful information from them. The values of standard electrode potentials for some selected half - cell reduction reactions are given in Table 2. 1. If the standard electrode potential of an electrode is greater than zero then its reduced form is more stable compared to hydrogen gas. Similarly, if the standard electrode potential is negative then hydrogen gas is more stable than the reduced form of the species. It can be seen that the standard electrode potential for fluorine is the highest in the Table indicating that fluorine gas(F) has the maximum 2 tendency to get reduced to fluoride ions(F) and therefore fluorine gas is the strongest oxidising agent and fluoride ion is the weakest reducing agent. Lithium has the lowest electrode potential indicating that lithium ion is the weakest oxidising agent while lithium metal is the most powerful reducing agent in an aqueous solution. It may be seen that as we go from top to bottom in Table 2. 1 the standard electrode potential decreases and with this, decreases the oxidising power of the species on the left and increases the reducing power of the species on the right hand side of the reaction. Electrochemical cells are extensively used for determining the Ph of solutions, solubility product, equilibrium constant and other thermodynamic properties and for potentiometric titrations.

This need not be always true. Nernst showed that for the electrode reaction: Mn +(aq) + ne fi M(s) the electrode potential at any concentration measured with respect to standard hydrogen electrode can be represented by: E = Eo RT[M](Mn + / M)(Mn + / M) Nf ln[Mn +] but concentration of solid M is taken as unity and we have RT 1 E(Mn + / M) = E(o Mn + / M) Nf ln[Mn +](2. 8) E(o Mn + / M) has already been defined, R is gas constant(8. 314 JK 1 mol 1), F is Faraday constant(96487 C mol 1), T is temperature in kelvin and[Mn +] is the concentration of the species, Mn +.

By converting the natural logarithm in Eq.(2. 11) to the base 10 and substituting the values of R, F and T = 298 K, it reduces to 0. 059[Zn 2 +] E(cell) = E(o cell) 2 log[Cu 2 +](2. 12) We should use the same number of electrons(n) for both the electrodes and thus for the following cell Ni(s) œ Ni2 +(aq) œœ Ag +(aq) œ Ag The cell reaction is Ni(s) + 2Ag +(aq) fi Ni2 +(aq) + 2Ag(s) The Nernst equation can be written as E = Eo RT ln[Ni2 +](cell)(cell) 2F[Ag +] 2 and for a general electrochemical reaction of the type: a A + Bb ne Cc + Dd Nernst equation can be written as: RT E = Eo 1nQ(cell)(cell) Nf = Eo RT ln[C] c[D] d(2. 13)(cell) Nf[A] a[B] b Chemistry 38 Reprint 2025 - 26 Represent the cell in which the following reaction takes place Example 22222. 11111 Mg(s) + 2Ag +(0. 0001M) fi Mg2 +(0. 130M) + 2Ag(s) Calculate its E if Eo = 3. 17 V.(cell)(cell) The cell can be written as Mgœ Mg2 +(0. 130M) œœ Ag +(0. 0001M) œ Ag Solution RT Mg2 + E = Eo ln cell(cell) 2F + 2 Ag 0. 059V 0. 130 = 3. 17 V log = 3. 17 V 0. 21V = 2. 96 V. 2(0. 0001) 2 2. 3. 1 Equilibrium If the circuit in Daniell cell(Fig. 2. 1) is closed then we note that the reaction Constant Zn(s) + Cu2 +(aq) fi Zn2 +(aq) + Cu(s)(2. 1) from Nernst takes place and as time passes, the concentration of Zn2 + keeps Equation on increasing while the concentration of Cu2 + keeps on decreasing. At the same time voltage of the cell as read on the voltmeter keeps on decreasing. After some time, we shall note that there is no change in the concentration of Cu2 + and Zn2 + ions and at the same time, voltmeter gives zero reading. This indicates that equilibrium has been attained. In this situation the Nernst equation may be written as: E = 0 = Eo 2. 303RT log[Zn2 +](cell)(cell) 2F[Cu2 +] 2. 303RT[Zn2] or Eo = log(cell) 2F[Cu2] But at equilibrium,[Zn2 +] = K for the reaction 2. 1[Cu2 +] c and at T = 298K the above equation can be written as 0. 059 V Eo = log K = 1. 1 V(Eo = 1. 1V)(cell) 2 C(cell)(1. 1V × 2) log K = 37. 288 C 0. 059 V K = 2 × 1037 at 298K. C In general, Eo = 2. 303RT log K(2. 14)(cell) Nf C Thus, Eq.(2. 14) gives a relationship between equilibrium constant of the reaction and standard potential of the cell in which that reaction takes place. Thus, equilibrium constants of the reaction, difficult to measure otherwise, can be calculated from the corresponding Eo value of the cell. 39 Electrochemistry Reprint 2025 - 26 Example 22222. 22222 Calculate the equilibrium constant of the reaction: Cu(s) + 2Ag +(aq) fi Cu2 +(aq) + 2Ag(s) Eo = 0. 46 V(cell) Solution E(o cell) = 0. 05 2 9 V log K C = 0. 46 V or 0. 46 V · 2 log K C = 0. 059V = 15. 6 K = 3. 92 × 1015 C 2. 3. 2 Electro - Electrical work done in one second is equal to electrical potential chemical multiplied by total charge passed. If we want to obtain maximum work Cell and from a galvanic cell then charge has to be passed reversibly. The Gibbs reversible work done by a galvanic cell is equal to decrease in its Gibbs Energy of energy and therefore, if the emf of the cell is E and Nf is the amount Thereaction of charge passed and D G is the Gibbs energy of the reaction, then r DG = Nfe(2. 15) r(cell) It may be remembered that E is an intensive parameter but DG(cell) r is an extensive thermodynamic property and the value depends on n. Thus, if we write the reaction Zn(s) + Cu2 +(aq)(cid: 190) fi Zn2 +(aq) + Cu(s)(2. 1) DG = 2FE r(cell) but when we write the reaction 2 Zn(s) + 2Cu2 +(aq)(cid: 190) fi2 Zn2 +(aq) + 2Cu(s) DG = 4FE r(cell) If the concentration of all the reacting species is unity, then E = Eo and we have(cell)(cell) Dgo = Nfeo(2. 16) r(cell) Thus, from the measurement of Eo we can obtain an important(cell) thermodynamic quantity, D Go, standard Gibbs energy of the reaction. R From the latter we can calculate equilibrium constant by the equation: Dgo = RT ln K. R Example 22222. 33333 The standard electrode potential for Daniell cell is 1. 1V.

The electrical resistance is represented by the symbol R and it is measured in ohm(W) Solutions which in terms of SI base units is equal to(kg m2) /(S3 A2). It can be measured with the help of a Wheatstone bridge with which you are familiar from your study of physics. The electrical resistance of any object is directly proportional to its length, l, and inversely proportional to its area of cross section, A. That is, l l R(cid: 181) or R = r(2. 17) A A The constant of proportionality, r(Greek, rho), is called resistivity(specific resistance). Its SI units are ohm metre(W m) and quite often its submultiple, ohm centimetre(W cm) is also used. IUPAC recommends the use of the term resistivity over specific resistance and hence in the rest of the book we shall use the term resistivity. Physically, the resistivity for a substance is its resistance when it is one metre long and its area of cross section is one m2. It can be seen that: 1 W m = 100 W cm or 1 W cm = 0. 01 W m The inverse of resistance, R, is called conductance, G, and we have the relation: 1 A A G = = = k(2. 18) R l l The SI unit of conductance is siemens, represented by the symbol S and is equal to ohm 1(also known as mho) or W 1. The inverse of resistivity, called conductivity(specific conductance) is represented by the symbol, k(Greek, kappa). IUPAC has recommended the use of term conductivity over specific conductance and hence we shall use the term conductivity in the rest of the book. The SI units of conductivity are S m 1 but quite often, k is expressed in S cm 1. Conductivity of a material in S m 1 is its conductance when it is 1 m long and its area of cross section is 1 m2. It may be noted that 1 S cm 1 = 100 S m 1. 41 Electrochemistry Reprint 2025 - 26 Table 2. 2: The values of Conductivity of some Selected Materials at 298. 15 K Material Conductivity / Material Conductivity / S m 1 S m 1 Conductors Aqueous Solutions Sodium 2. 1 × 103 Pure water 3. 5 × 10 5 Copper 5. 9 × 103 0. 1 M Hcl 3. 91 Silver 6. 2 × 103 0. 01M Kcl 0. 14 Gold 4. 5 × 103 0. 01M Nacl 0. 12 Iron 1. 0 × 103 0. 1 M Hac 0. 047 Graphite 1. 2 × 10 0. 01M Hac 0. 016 Insulators Semiconductors Glass 1. 0 × 10 16 Cuo 1 × 10 7 Teflon 1. 0 × 10 18 Si 1. 5 × 10 2 Ge 2. 0 It can be seen from Table 2. 2 that the magnitude of conductivity varies a great deal and depends on the nature of the material. It also depends on the temperature and pressure at which the measurements are made. Materials are classified into conductors, insulators and semiconductors depending on the magnitude of their conductivity. Metals and their alloys have very large conductivity and are known as conductors. Certain non - metals like carbon - black, graphite and some organic polymers * are also electronically conducting. Substances like glass, ceramics, etc., having very low conductivity are known as insulators. Substances like silicon, doped silicon and gallium arsenide having conductivity between conductors and insulators are called semiconductors and are important electronic materials. Certain materials called superconductors by definition have zero resistivity or infinite conductivity. Earlier, only metals and their alloys at very low temperatures(0 to 15 K) were known to behave as superconductors, but nowadays a number of ceramic materials and mixed oxides are also known to show superconductivity at temperatures as high as 150 K. Electrical conductance through metals is called metallic or electronic conductance and is due to the movement of electrons. The electronic conductance depends on(i) the nature and structure of the metal(ii) the number of valence electrons per atom(i) temperature(it decreases with increase of temperature). * Electronically conducting polymers In 1977 Macdiarmid, Heeger and Shirakawa discovered that acetylene gas can be polymerised to produce a polymer, polyacetylene when exposed to vapours of iodine acquires metallic lustre and conductivity. Since then several organic conducting polymers have been made such as polyaniline, polypyrrole and polythiophene. These organic polymers which have properties like metals, being composed wholly of elements like carbon, hydrogen and occasionally nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur, are much lighter than normal metals and can be used for making light - weight batteries. Besides, they have the mechanical properties of polymers such as flexibility so that one can make electronic devices such as transistors that can bend like a sheet of plastic. For the discovery of conducting polymers, Macdiarmid, Heeger and Shirakawa were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the year 2000. Chemistry 42 Reprint 2025 - 26 As the electrons enter at one end and go out through the other end, the composition of the metallic conductor remains unchanged. The mechanism of conductance through semiconductors is more complex. We already know that even very pure water has small amounts of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions(~ 10 7M) which lend it very low conductivity(3. 5 × 10 5 S m 1). When electrolytes are dissolved in water, they furnish their own ions in the solution hence its conductivity also increases. The conductance of electricity by ions present in the solutions is called electrolytic or ionic conductance. The conductivity of electrolytic(ionic) solutions depends on:(i) the nature of the electrolyte added(ii) size of the ions produced and their solvation(i) the nature of the solvent and its viscosity(iv) concentration of the electrolyte(v) temperature(it increases with the increase of temperature). Passage of direct current through ionic solution over a prolonged period can lead to change in its composition due to electrochemical reactions(Section 2. 4. 1). 2. 4. 1 Measurement We know that accurate measurement of an unknown resistance can be of the performed on a Wheatstone bridge. However, for measuring the resistance Conductivity of an ionic solution we face two problems. Firstly, passing direct current of Ionic(DC) changes the composition of the solution. Secondly, a solution cannot Solutions be connected to the bridge like a metallic wire or other solid conductor. The first difficulty is resolved by using an alternating current(AC) source of power. The second problem is solved by using a specially designed vessel called conductivity cell. It is available in several designs and two simple ones are shown in Fig. 2. 4. Connecting Connecting wires wires Platinized Pt Fig. 2. 4 electrodes Two different types of conductivity cells. Platinized Pt electrode Platinized Pt electrode Basically it consists of two platinum electrodes coated with platinum black(finely divided metallic Pt is deposited on the electrodes electrochemically). These have area of cross section equal to A and are separated by distance l. Therefore, solution confined between these electrodes is a column of length l and area of cross section A. The resistance of such a column of solution is then given by the equation: l l R = r =(2. 17) A A 43 Electrochemistry Reprint 2025 - 26 The quantity l / A is called cell constant denoted by the symbol, G *. It depends on the distance between the electrodes and their area of cross - section and has the dimension of length 1 and can be calculated if we know l and A. Measurement of l and A is not only inconvenient but also unreliable. The cell constant is usually determined by measuring the resistance of the cell containing a solution whose conductivity is already known. For this purpose, we generally use Kcl solutions whose conductivity is known accurately at various concentrations(Table 2. 3) and at different temperatures. The cell constant, G *, is then given by the equation: l G * = = R k(2. 18) A Table 2. 3: Conductivity and Molar conductivity of Kcl solutions at 298. 15K Concentration / Molarity Conductivity Molar Conductivity mol L 1 mol m 3 S cm 1 S m 1 S cm2mol 1 S m2 mol 1 1. 000 1000 0. 1113 11. 13 111. 3 111. 3 × 10 4 0. 100 100. 0 0. 0129 1. 29 129. 0 129. 0 × 10 4 0. 010 10. 00 0. 00141 0. 141 141. 0 141. 0 × 10 4 Once the cell constant is determined, we can use it for measuring the resistance or conductivity of any solution. The set up for the measurement of the resistance is shown in Fig. 2. 5. It consists of two resistances R and R, a 3 4 variable resistance R and the conductivity cell 1 having the unknown resistance R. The 2 Wheatstone bridge is fed by an oscillator O(a source of a. c. Power in the audio frequency range 550 to 5000 cycles per second). P is a suitable detector(a headphone or other electronic device) and the bridge is balanced when no current passes through the detector. Under these conditions: Fig. 2. 5: Arrangement for measurement of R R Unknown resistance R = 1 4(2. 19) resistance of a solution of an 2 R electrolyte. 3 These days, inexpensive conductivity meters are available which can directly read the conductance or resistance of the solution in the conductivity cell. Once the cell constant and the resistance of the solution in the cell is determined, the conductivity of the solution is given by the equation: cell constant G *(2. 20) R R The conductivity of solutions of different electrolytes in the same solvent and at a given temperature differs due to charge and size ofthe Chemistry 44 Reprint 2025 - 26 ions in which they dissociate, the concentration of ions or ease with which the ions move under a potential gradient. It, therefore, becomes necessary to define a physically more meaningful quantity called molar conductivity denoted by the symbol L(Greek, lambda). It is related m to the conductivity of the solution by the equation: Molar conductivity = L =(2. 21) m c In the above equation, if k is expressed in S m 1 and the concentration, c in mol m 3 then the units of L are in S m2 mol 1. It may be noted that: m 1 mol m 3 = 1000(L / m3) × molarity(mol / L), and hence(S cm 1) L(S cm2 mol 1) = m 1000 L m 3 × molarity(mol L 1) If we use S cm 1 as the units for k and mol cm 3, the units of concentration, then the units for L are S cm2 mol 1. It can be calculated m by using the equation:(S cm 1) × 1000(cm3 / L) L(S cm2 mol 1) = m molarity(mol / L) Both type of units are used in literature and are related to each other by the equations: 1 S m2mol 1 = 104 S cm2mol 1 or 1 S cm2mol 1 = 10 4 S m2mol 1. Resistance of a conductivity cell filled with 0. 1 mol L 1 Kcl solution is Example 22222. 44444 100 W. If the resistance of the same cell when filled with 0. 02 mol L 1 Kcl solution is 520 W, calculate the conductivity and molar conductivity of 0. 02 mol L 1 Kcl solution.

M c 50 mol m 3 2. 4. 2 Variation of Both conductivity and molar conductivity change with the Conductivity concentration of the electrolyte. Conductivity always decreases with and Molar decrease in concentration both, for weak and strong electrolytes. Conductivity This can be explained by the fact that the number of ions per unit with volume that carry the current in a solution decreases on dilution. Concentration The conductivity of a solution at any given concentration is the conductance of one unit volume of solution kept between two Chemistry 46 Reprint 2025 - 26 platinum electrodes with unit area of cross section and at a distance of unit length. This is clear from the equation: A G = =(both A and l are unity in their appropriate units in l m or cm) Molar conductivity of a solution at a given concentration is the conductance of the volume V of solution containing one mole of electrolyte kept between two electrodes with area of cross section A and distance of unit length. Therefore, A = = m l Since l = 1 and A = V(volume containing 1 mole of electrolyte) L = k V(2. 22) m Molar conductivity increases with decrease in concentration. This is because the total volume, V, of solution containing one mole of electrolyte also increases. It has been found that decrease in k on dilution of a solution is more than compensated by increase in its volume. Physically, it means that at a given concentration, L can be defined m as the conductance of the electrolytic solution kept between the electrodes of a conductivity cell at unit distance but having area of cross section large enough to accommodate sufficient volume of solution that contains one mole of the electrolyte. When concentration approaches zero, the molar conductivity is known as limiting molar conductivity and is represented by the Fig. 2. 6: Molar conductivity versus c1 2 for acetic acid(weak electrolyte) and potassium symbol L(cid: 176) m. The variation in L m with chloride(strong electrolyte) in aqueous concentration is different(Fig. 2. 6) for solutions. Strong and weak electrolytes. Strongelectrolytes For strong electrolytes, L increases slowly with dilution and can be m represented by the equation: L = L(cid: 176) A c 1 2(2. 23) m m It can be seen that if we plot(Fig. 2. 6) L against m c1 / 2, we obtain a straight line with intercept equal to L(cid: 176) and slope m equal to A. The value of the constant A for a given solvent and temperature depends on the type of electrolyte i. e., the charges on the cation and anion produced on the dissociation of the electrolyte in the solution. Thus, Nacl, Cacl, MgSO are known as 1 - 1, 2 - 1 and 2 - 2 2 4 electrolytes respectively. All electrolytes of a particular type have the same value for A. 47 Electrochemistry Reprint 2025 - 26 Example 22222. 66666 The molar conductivity of Kcl solutions at different concentrations at 298 K are given below: c / mol L 1 L / S cm2 mol 1 m 0. 000198 148. 61 0. 000309 148. 29 0. 000521 147. 81 0. 000989 147. 09 Show that a plot between L and c1 / 2 is a straight line.

M It can be seen that it is nearly a straight line. From the intercept(c1 / 2 = 0), we find that L(cid: 176) = 150. 0 S cm2 mol 1 and m A = slope = 87. 46 S cm2 mol 1 /(mol / L 1) 1 / 2. Fig. 2. 7: Variation of L against c1 2. M Chemistry 48 Reprint 2025 - 26 L(cid: 176) Kohlrausch examined m values for a number of strong electrolytes L(cid: 176) and observed certain regularities. He noted that the difference in m of the electrolytes Nax and KX for any X is nearly constant. For example at 298 K: L(cid: 176) m(Kcl) L(cid: 176) m(Nacl) = L(cid: 176) m(Kbr) L(cid: 176) m(Nabr) = L(cid: 176) m(KI) L(cid: 176) m(Nai) 23. 4 S cm2 mol 1 and similarly it was found that L(cid: 176) m(Nabr) L(cid: 176) m(Nacl) = L(cid: 176) m(Kbr) L(cid: 176) m(Kcl) 1. 8 S cm2 mol 1 On the basis of the above observations he enunciated Kohlrausch law of independent migration of ions. The law states that limiting molar conductivity of an electrolyte can be represented as the sum of the individual contributions of the anion and cation of the electrolyte. Thus, if l(cid: 176) + and l ° are limiting molar conductivity of the sodium and chloride Na Cl ions respectively, then the limiting molar conductivity for sodium chloride is given by the equation: L(cid: 176) m = l(cid: 176) + + l(cid: 176)(2. 24)(Nacl) Na Cl n n In general, if an electrolyte on dissociation gives cations and + anions then its limiting molar conductivity is given by: L(cid: 176) m = n + l(cid: 176) + + n l(cid: 176)(2. 25) Here, l(cid: 176) and l(cid: 176) are the limiting molar conductivities of the cation and anion r + espectiv ely. The values of l(cid: 176) for some cations and anions at 298 K are given in Table 2. 4. Table 2. 4: Limiting Molar Conductivity for some Ions in Water at 298 K Ion l0 /(S cm2mol 1) Ion l0 /(S cm2 mol 1) H + 349. 6 OH 199. 1 Na + 50. 1 Cl 76. 3 K + 73. 5 Br 78. 1 Ca2 + 119. 0 CH COO 40. 9 3 2 Mg2 + 106. 0 SO 160. 0 4 Weak Electrolytes Weak electrolytes like acetic acid have lower degree of dissociation at L higher concentrations and hence for such electrolytes, the change in m with dilution is due to increase in the degree of dissociation and consequently the number of ions in total volume of solution that contains L 1 mol of electrolyte. In such cases m increases steeply(Fig. 2. 6) on L(cid: 176) dilution, especially near lower concentrations. Therefore, m cannot be L obtained by extrapolation of m to zero concentration. At infinite dilution(i. e., concentration c fi zero) electrolyte dissociates completely(a = 1), but at such low concentration the conductivity of the solution is so low L(cid: 176) that it cannot be measured accurately. Therefore, m for weak electrolytes is obtained by using Kohlrausch law of independent migration of ions(Example 2. 8). At any concentration c, if a is the degree of dissociation 49 Electrochemistry Reprint 2025 - 26 then it can be approximated to the ratio of molar conductivity L m at the concentration c to limiting molar conductivity, L0. Thus we have: m = m(2. 26) ° m But we know that for a weak electrolyte like acetic acid(Class XI, Unit 7), c 2 c 2 c 2 K = = m = m a 1 2 1 m m m m(2. 27) m m Applications of Kohlrausch law Using Kohlrausch law of independent migration of ions, it is possible to calculate L0 for any electrolyte from the lo of individual ions.

The electrochemical processes are of great importance Cels and in the laboratory and the chemical industry. One of the simplest electrolytic Electrolysis cell consists of two copper strips dipping in an aqueous solution of copper sulphate. If a DC voltage is applied to the two electrodes, then Cu 2 + ions discharge at the cathode(negatively charged) and the following reaction takes place: Cu2 +(aq) + 2e fi Cu(s)(2. 28) Copper metal is deposited on the cathode. At the anode, copper is converted into Cu2 + ions by the reaction: Cu(s) fi Cu2 +(s) + 2e(2. 29) Thus copper is dissolved(oxidised) at anode and deposited(reduced) at cathode. This is the basis for an industrial process in which impure copper is converted into copper of high purity. The impure copper is made an anode that dissolves on passing current and pure copper is deposited at the cathode. Many metals like Na, Mg, Al, etc. Are produced on large scale by electrochemical reduction of their respective cations where no suitable chemical reducing agents are available for this purpose. Sodium and magnesium metals are produced by the electrolysis of their fused chlorides and aluminium is produced by electrolysis of aluminium oxide in presence of cryolite. Quantitative Aspects of Electrolysis Michael Faraday was the first scientist who described the quantitative aspects of electrolysis. Now Faraday s laws also flow from what has been discussed earlier. Faraday s Laws of Electrolysis After his extensive investigations on electrolysis of solutions and melts of electrolytes, Faraday published his results during 1833 - 34 in the form of the following well known Faraday s two laws of electrolysis:(i) First Law: The amount of chemical reaction which occurs at any electrode during electrolysis by a current is proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the electrolyte(solution or melt).(ii) Second Law: The amounts of different substances liberated by the same quantity of electricity passing through the electrolytic solution are proportional to their chemical equivalent weights(Atomic Mass of Metal ÷ Number of electrons required to reduce the cation). 51 Electrochemistry Reprint 2025 - 26 There were no constant current sources available during Faraday s times. The general practice was to put a coulometer(a standard electrolytic cell) for determining the quantity of electricity passed from the amount of metal(generally silver or copper) deposited or consumed. However, coulometers are now obsolete and we now have constant current(I) sources available and the quantity of electricity Q, passed is given by Q = It Q is in coloumbs when I is in ampere and t is in second. The amount of electricity(or charge) required for oxidation or reduction depends on the stoichiometry of the electrode reaction. For example, in the reaction: Ag +(aq) + e fi Ag(s)(2. 30) One mole of the electron is required for the reduction of one mole of silver ions. We know that charge on one electron is equal to 1. 6021 × 10 19C. Therefore, the charge on one mole of electrons is equal to: N × 1. 6021 × 10 19 C = 6. 02 × 1023mol 1 × 1. 6021 × 10 19 A C = 96487 C mol 1 This quantity of electricity is called Faraday and is represented by the symbol F. For approximate calculations we use 1F 96500 C mol 1. For the electrode reactions: Mg2 +(l) + 2e(cid: 190) fi Mg(s)(2. 31) Al3 +(l) + 3e(cid: 190) fi Al(s)(2. 32) It is obvious that one mole of Mg2 + and Al3 + require 2 mol of electrons(2F) and 3 mol of electrons(3F) respectively. The charge passed through the electrolytic cell during electrolysis is equal to the product of current in amperes and time in seconds. In commercial production of metals, current as high as 50, 000 amperes are used that amounts to about 0. 518 F per second. Example 22222. 1111100000 A solution of CuSO is electrolysed for 10 minutes with a current of 4 1. 5 amperes. What is the mass of copper deposited at the cathode? Solution t = 600 s charge = current × time = 1. 5 A × 600 s = 900 C According to the reaction: Cu2 +(aq) + 2e = Cu(s) We require 2F or 2 × 96487 C to deposit 1 mol or 63 g of Cu. For 900 C, the mass of Cu deposited =(63 g mol 1 × 900 C) /(2 × 96487 C mol 1) = 0. 2938 g. 2. 5. 1 Products of Products of electrolysis depend on the nature of material being Electrolysis electrolysed and the type of electrodes being used. If the electrode is inert(e. g., platinum or gold), it does not participate in the chemical reaction and acts only as source or sink for electrons. On the other hand, if the electrode is reactive, it participates in the electrode reaction. Thus, the products of electrolysis may be different for reactive and inert Chemistry 52 Reprint 2025 - 26 electrodes. The products of electrolysis depend on the different oxidising and reducing species present in the electrolytic cell and their standard electrode potentials. Moreover, some of the electrochemical processes although feasible, are so slow kinetically that at lower voltages these do not seem to take place and extra potential(called overpotential) has to be applied, which makes such process more difficult to occur. For example, if we use molten Nacl, the products of electrolysis are sodium metal and Cl gas. Here we have only one cation(Na +) which is 2 reduced at the cathode(Na + + e fi Na) and one anion(Cl) which is oxidised at the anode(Cl fi 1 2Cl + e). During the electrolysis of aqueous 2 sodium chloride solution, the products are NaOH, Cl and H. In this 2 2 case besides Na + and Cl ions we also have H + and OH ions along with the solvent molecules, H O. 2 At the cathode there is competition between the following reduction reactions: Na +(aq) + e fi Na(s) Eo = 2. 71 V(cell) H +(aq) + e fi 1 2 H(g) Eo = 0. 00 V 2(cell) The reaction with higher value of Eo is preferred and therefore, the reaction at the cathode during electrolysis is: H +(aq) + e fi 1 2 H(g)(2. 33) 2 but H +(aq) is produced by the dissociation of H O, i. e., 2 H O(l) fi H +(aq) + OH(aq)(2. 34) 2 Therefore, the net reaction at the cathode may be written as the sum of(2. 33) and(2. 34) and we have H O(l) + e fi 1 2H(g) + OH(2. 35) 2 2 At the anode the following oxidation reactions are possible: Cl(aq) fi 1 2 Cl(g) + e Eo = 1. 36 V(2. 36) 2(cell) 2H O(l) fi O(g) + 4H +(aq) + 4e Eo = 1. 23 V(2. 37) 2 2(cell) The reaction at anode with lower value of Eo is preferred and therefore, water should get oxidised in preference to Cl(aq). However, on account of overpotential of oxygen, reaction(2. 36) is preferred. Thus, the net reactions may be summarised as: Nacl(aq)(cid: 190)(cid: 190)(cid: 190) H 2fiO(cid: 190) Na +(aq) + Cl(aq) Cathode: H O(l) + e fi 1 2 H(g) + OH(aq) 2 2 Anode: Cl(aq) fi 1 2 Cl(g) + e 2 Net reaction: Nacl(aq) + H O(l) fi Na +(aq) + OH(aq) + 1 2H(g) + 1 2Cl(g) 2 2 2 The standard electrode potentials are replaced by electrode potentials given by Nernst equation(Eq. 2. 8) to take into account the concentration effects. During the electrolysis of sulphuric acid, the following processes are possible at the anode: 2H O(l) fi O(g) + 4H +(aq) + 4e Eo = + 1. 23 V(2. 38) 2 2(cell) 53 Electrochemistry Reprint 2025 - 26 2SO 2(aq) fi S O 2(aq) + 2e Eo = 1. 96 V(2. 39) 4 2 8(cell) For dilute sulphuric acid, reaction(2. 38) is preferred but at higher concentrations of H SO, reaction(2. 39) is preferred. 2 4 Intext Questions 2. 10 If a current of 0. 5 ampere flows through a metallic wire for 2 hours, then how many electrons would flow through the wire? 2. 11 Suggest a list of metals that are extracted electrolytically. 2. 12 Consider the reaction: Cr O 2 + 14H + + 6e fi 2Cr3 + + 7H O 2 7 2 What is the quantity of electricity in coulombs needed to reduce 1 mol of Cr O 2? 2 7 22222. 66666 Bateries Any battery(actually it may have one or more than one cell connected in series) or cell that we use as a source of electrical energy is basically a galvanic cell where the chemical energy of the redox reaction is converted into electrical energy. However, for a battery to be of practical use it should be reasonably light, compact and its voltage should not vary appreciably during its use. There are mainly two types of batteries. 2. 6. 1 Primary In the primary batteries, the reaction occurs only once and after use Batteries over a period of time battery becomes dead and cannot be reused again. The most familiar example of this type is the dry cell(known as Leclanche cell after its discoverer) which is used commonly in our transistors and clocks. The cell consists of a zinc container that also acts as anode and the cathode is a carbon(graphite) rod surrounded by powdered manganese dioxide and carbon(Fig. 2. 8). The space between the electrodes is filled by a moist paste of ammonium chloride(NH Cl) and zinc chloride(Zncl). The 4 2 electrode reactions are complex, but they can be written approximately as follows: Anode: Zn(s)(cid: 190) fi Zn2 + + 2e Cathode: Mno + NH + + e(cid: 190) fi Mno(OH) + NH 2 4 3 In the reaction at cathode, manganese is reduced from the + 4 oxidation state to the + 3 state. Ammonia produced in the reaction forms a complex with Zn2 + to give[Zn(NH)] 2 +. The cell has a potential of nearly 1. 5 V. 34 Mercury cell,(Fig. 2. 9) suitable for low current devices like hearing aids, watches, etc. Consists of zinc mercury amalgam as anode and a paste of Hgo and carbon as the Fig. 2. 8: A commercial dry cell cathode. The electrolyte is a paste of KOH and Zno. The consists of a graphite electrode reactions for the cell are given below:(carbon) cathode in a Anode: Zn(Hg) + 2OH(cid: 190) fi Zno(s) + H O + 2e zinc container; the latter 2 Cathode: Hgo + H O + 2e(cid: 190) fi Hg(l) + 2OH acts as the anode. 2 Chemistry 54 Reprint 2025 - 26 The overall reaction is represented by Zn(Hg) + Hgo(s)(cid: 190) fi Zno(s) + Hg(l) The cell potential is approximately 1. 35 V and remains constant during its life as the overall reaction does not Fig. 2. 9 Commonly used involve any ion in solution whose mercury cell. The concentration can change during its life reducing agent is time. Zinc and the oxidising agent is mercury(II) oxide. 2. 6. 2 Secondary A secondary cell after use can be recharged by passing current Batteries through it in the opposite direction so that it can be used again. A good secondary cell can undergo a large number of discharging and charging cycles. The most important secondary cell is the lead storage battery(Fig. 2. 10) commonly used in automobiles and invertors. It consists of a lead anode and a grid of lead packed with lead dioxide(Pbo) as cathode. A 38 % solution of sulphuric acid 2 is used as an electrolyte. The cell reactions when the battery is in use are given below: Anode: Pb(s) + SO 2(aq) fi PbSO(s) + 2e 4 4 Cathode: Pbo(s) + SO 2(aq) + 4H +(aq) + 2e fi PbSO(s) + 2H O(l) 2 4 4 2 i. e., overall cell reaction consisting of cathode and anode reactions is: Pb(s) + Pbo(s) + 2H SO(aq) fi 2PbSO(s) + 2H O(l) 2 2 4 4 2 On charging the battery the reaction is reversed and PbSO(s) on 4 anode and cathode is converted into Pb and Pbo, respectively. 2 Fig. 2. 10: The Lead storage battery. 55 Electrochemistry Reprint 2025 - 26 Another important secondary cell is the nickel - cadmium cell(Fig. 2. 11) which has longer life than the lead storage cell but more expensive to manufacture. Fig. 2. 11 A rechargeable We shall not go into details of nickel - cadmium cell working of the cell and the Positive plate in a jelly roll electrode reactions during arrangement and Separator charging and discharging. Separated by a layer The overall reaction during Negative plate soaked in moist discharge is: sodium or potassium hydroxide. Cd(s) + 2Ni(OH)(s) fi Cdo(s) + 2Ni(OH)(s) + H O(l) 3 2 2 22222. 77777 Fuel Cels Production of electricity by thermal plants is not a very efficient method and is a major source of pollution. In such plants, the chemical energy(heat of combustion) of fossil fuels(coal, gas or oil) is first used for converting water into high pressure steam. This is then used to run a turbine to produce electricity. We know that a galvanic cell directly converts chemical energy into electricity and is highly efficient. It is now possible to make such cells in which reactants are fed continuously to the electrodes and products are removed continuously from the electrolyte compartment. Galvanic cells that are designed to convert the energy of combustion of fuels like hydrogen, methane, methanol, etc. Directly into electrical energy are called fuel cells. One of the most successful fuel cells uses the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen to form water(Fig. 2. 12). The cell was used for providing electrical power in the Apollo space programme. The water vapours produced during the reaction were condensed and added to the drinking water supply for the astronauts. In the cell, hydrogen and oxygen are bubbled through porous carbon electrodes into concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. Catalysts like finely divided platinum or palladium metal are incorporated into the electrodes for increasing the rate of electrode Fig. 2. 12: Fuel cell using H and O produces electricity. 2 2 reactions. The electrode reactions are given below: Cathode: O(g) + 2H O(l) + 4e(cid: 190) fi 4OH(aq) 2 2 Anode: 2H(g) + 4OH(aq)(cid: 190) fi 4H O(l) + 4e 2 2 Overall reaction being: 2H(g) + O(g)(cid: 190) fi 2H O(l) 2 2 2 The cell runs continuously as long as the reactants are supplied. Fuel cells produce electricity with an efficiency of about 70 % compared Chemistry 56 Reprint 2025 - 26 to thermal plants whose efficiency is about 40 %. There has been tremendous progress in the development of new electrode materials, better catalysts and electrolytes for increasing the efficiency of fuel cells. These have been used in automobiles on an experimental basis. Fuel cells are pollution free and in view of their future importance, a variety of fuel cells have been fabricated and tried. 22222. 88888 Corosion Corrosion slowly coats the surfaces of metallic objects with oxides or other salts of the metal. The rusting of iron, tarnishing of silver, development of green coating on copper and bronze are some of the examples of corrosion. It causes enormous damage to buildings, bridges, ships and to all objects made of metals especially that of iron. We lose crores of rupees every year on account of corrosion. In corrosion, a metal is oxidised by loss of electrons to oxygen and formation of oxides. Corrosion of iron(commonly known as rusting) occurs in presence of water and air. The chemistry of corrosion is quite complex but it may be considered Oxidation: Fe(s) fi Fe2 +(aq) + 2e essentially as an electrochemical Reduction: O(g) + 4H +(aq) + 4e fi 2H O(l) 2 2 phenomenon. At a particular spot Atomospheric(Fig. 2. 13) of an object made of iron, oxidation: 2Fe2 +(aq) + 2H O(l) + 1 2O(g) fi Fe O(s) + 4H +(aq) 2 2 2 3 oxidation takes place and that spot behaves as anode and we can write Fig. 2. 13: Corrosion of iron in atmosphere the reaction Eo Anode: 2 Fe(s)(cid: 190) fi 2 Fe2 + + 4 e = 0. 44 V(Fe2 + / Fe) Electrons released at anodic spot move through the metal and go to another spot on the metal and reduce oxygen in the presence of H +(which is believed to be available from H CO formed due to dissolution 2 3 of carbon dioxide from air into water. Hydrogen ion in water may also be available due to dissolution of other acidic oxides from the atmosphere). This spot behaves as cathode with the reaction Eo Cathode: O(g) + 4 H +(aq) + 4 e(cid: 190) fi 2 H O(l) = 1. 23V 2 2 H + | O 2 | H 2 O The overall reaction being: 2Fe(s) + O(g) + 4H +(aq)(cid: 190) fi 2Fe2 +(aq) + 2 H O(l) Eo = 1. 67 V 2 2(cell) The ferrous ions are further oxidised by atmospheric oxygen to ferric ions which come out as rust in the form of hydrated ferric oxide(Fe O. X H O) and with further production of hydrogen ions. 2 3 2 Prevention of corrosion is of prime importance. It not only saves money but also helps in preventing accidents such as a bridge collapse or failure of a key component due to corrosion. One of the simplest methods of preventing corrosion is to prevent the surface of the metallic object to come in contact with atmosphere. This can be done by covering the surface with paint or by some chemicals(e. g. Bisphenol). Another simple method is to cover the surface by other metals(Sn, Zn, etc.) that are inert or react to save the object. An electrochemical method is to provide a sacrificial electrode of another metal(like Mg, Zn, etc.) which corrodes itself but saves the object. 57 Electrochemistry Reprint 2025 - 26 Intext Questions 2. 13 Write the chemistry of recharging the lead storage battery, highlighting all the materials that are involved during recharging. 2. 14 Suggest two materials other than hydrogen that can be used as fuels in fuel cells. 2. 15 Explain how rusting of iron is envisaged as setting up of an electrochemical cell. The Hydrogen Economy At present the main source of energy that is driving our economy is fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. As more people on the planet aspire to improve their standard of living, their energy requirement will increase. In fact, the per capita consumption of energy used is a measure of development. Of course, it is assumed that energy is used for productive purpose and not merely wasted. We are already aware that carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of fossil fuels is resulting in the Greenhouse Effect. This is leading to a rise in the temperature of the Earth s surface, causing polar ice to melt and ocean levels to rise. This will flood low - lying areas along the coast and some island nations such as Maldives face total submergence. In order to avoid such a catastrope, we need to limit our use of carbonaceous fuels. Hydrogen provides an ideal alternative as its combustion results in water only. Hydrogen production must come from splitting water using solar energy. Therefore, hydrogen can be used as a renewable and non polluting source of energy. This is the vision of the Hydrogen Economy. Both the production of hydrogen by electrolysis of water and hydrogen combustion in a fuel cell will be important in the future. And both these technologies are based on electrochemical principles. Sumary An electrochemical cell consists of two metallic electrodes dipping in electrolytic solution(s). Thus an important component of the electrochemical cell is the ionic conductor or electrolyte. Electrochemical cells are of two types. In galvanic cell, the chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction is converted into electrical work, whereas in an electrolytic cell, electrical energy is used to carry out a non - spontaneous redox reaction. The standard electrode potential for any electrode dipping in an appropriate solution is defined with respect to standard electrode potential of hydrogen electrode taken as zero. The standard potential of the cell can be obtained by taking the difference of the standard potentials of cathode and anode(E(o cell) = Eo cathode Eo anode). The standard potential of the cells are related to standard Gibbs energy(Drgo = Nfe(o cell)) and equilibrium constant(Drgo = RT ln K) of the reaction taking place in the cell. Concentration dependence of the potentials of the electrodes and the cells are given by Nernst equation. The conductivity, k, of an electrolytic solution depends on the concentration of the electrolyte, nature of solvent and temperature. Molar conductivity, L m, is defined by = k / c where c is the concentration. Conductivity decreases but molar conductivity increases with decrease in concentration. It increases slowly with decrease in concentration for strong electrolytes while the increase is very steep for weak electrolytes in very dilute solutions. Kohlrausch found that molar conductivity at infinite dilution, for an electrolyte is sum of the contribution of the Chemistry 58 Reprint 2025 - 26 molar conductivity of the ions in which it dissociates. It is known as law of independent migration of ions and has many applications. Ions conduct electricity through the solution but oxidation and reduction of the ions take place at the electrodes in an electrochemical cell. Batteries and fuel cells are very useful forms of galvanic cell. Corrosion of metals is essentially an electrochemical phenomenon. Electrochemical principles are relevant to the Hydrogen Economy.

At the molecular level, the reaction mechanisms involving\norientation and energy of molecules undergoing collisions,\nare discussed.\nIn this Unit, we shall be dealing with average and instantaneous\nrate of reaction and the factors affecting these. Some elementary\nideas about the collision theory of reaction rates are also given.\nHowever, in order to understand all these, let us first learn about the\nreaction rate.\n33333.....11111 RRRRRaaaaattttteeeee ooooofffff aaaaa\nSome reactions such as ionic reactions occur very fast, for example,\nCCCCChhhhheeeeemmmmmiiiiicccccaaaaalllll precipitation of silver chloride occurs instantaneously by mixing of\naqueous solutions of silver nitrate and sodium chloride.

Also there are reactions like inversion\nof cane sugar and hydrolysis of starch, which proceed with a moderate\nspeed. Can you think of more examples from each category?\nYou must be knowing that speed of an automobile is expressed in\nterms of change in the position or distance covered by it in a certain\nperiod of time. Similarly, the speed of a reaction or the rate of a\nreaction can be defined as the change in concentration of a reactant\nor product in unit time. To be more specific, it can be expressed in\nterms of:\n(i) the rate of decrease in concentration of any one of the\nreactants,or\n(ii) the rate of increase in concentration of any one of the products.\nConsider a hypothetical reaction, assuming that the volume of the\nsystem remains constant.\nR fi P\nOne mole of the reactant R produces one mole of the product P.

For example, if concentration is in mol L–1 and\ntime is in seconds then the units will be mol L-1s–1. However, in gaseous\nreactions, when the concentration of gases is expressed in terms of their\npartial pressures, then the units of the rate equation will be atm s–1.\nFrom the concentrations of C H Cl (butyl chloride) at different times given EEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 33333.....11111\n4 9\nbelow, calculate the average rate of the reaction:\nC H Cl + H O fi C H OH + HCl\n4 9 2 4 9\nduring different intervals of time.\nt/s 0 50 100 150 200 300 400 700 800\n[C H Cl]/mol L–1 0.100 0.0905 0.0820 0.0741 0.0671 0.0549 0.0439 0.0210 0.017\n4 9\nWe can determine the difference in concentration over different intervals SSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\nof time and thus determine the average rate by dividing D[R] by Dt\n(Table 3.1).\n63 Chemical Kinetics\nReprint 2025-26\nTable 3.1: Average rates of hydrolysis of butyl chloride\n[C H CI] / [C H CI] / t /s t /s r × 104/mol L–1s–1\n4 m 9 ol L t 1 –1 m 4 o 9 l L t – 2 1 1 2 = a v – { [ C H Cl ] – [ C H Cl ] / ( t - t ) } · 104\n4 9 t2 4 9 t1 2 1\n0.100 0.0905 0 50 1.90\n0.0905 0.0820 50 100 1.70\n0.0820 0.0741 100 150 1.58\n0.0741 0.0671 150 200 1.40\n0.0671 0.0549 200 300 1.22\n0.0549 0.0439 300 400 1.10\n0.0439 0.0335 400 500 1.04\n0.0210 0.017 700 800 0.4\nIt can be seen (Table 3.1) that the average rate falls from 1.90× 0-4 mol L-1s-1 to\n0.4 × 10-4 mol L-1s-1. However, average rate cannot be used to predict the\nrate of a reaction at a particular instant as it would be constant for the\ntime interval for which it is calculated. So, to express the rate at a particular\nmoment of time we determine the instantaneous rate. It is obtained\nwhen we consider the average rate at the smallest time interval say dt ( i.e.\nwhen Dt approaches zero).

So in problem 3.1, r at 600s for example, can be\ninst\ncalculated by plotting concentration of butyl chloride as a function of\ntime. A tangent is drawn that touches the curve at t = 600 s (Fig. 3.2).\nThe slope of this tangent gives the instantaneous rate.\nSo, r at 600 s = – mol L–1 = 5.12 × 10–5 mol L–1s–1\ninst\nAt t = 250 s r = 1.22 × 10–4mol L–1s–1\ninst\nt = 350 s r = 1.0 × 10–4 mol L–1s–1\ninst\nt = 450 s r = 6.4 ×× 10–5 mol L–1s–1\ninst\nNow consider a reaction\nHg(l) + Cl (g) fiHgCl (s)\n2 2\nWhere stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants and products are\nsame, then rate of the reaction is given as\n[ ] [ ] [ ]\nD Hg D Cl D HgCl\nRate of reaction = – = – 2 = 2\nD t D t D t\ni.e., rate of disappearance of any of the reactants is same as the rate\nof appearance of the products.

The\nConcentration representation of rate of reaction in terms of concentration of the\nreactants is known as rate law. It is also called as rate equation or\nrate expression.\n3.2.2 Rate The results in Table 3.1 clearly show that rate of a reaction decreases with\nExpression the passage of time as the concentration of reactants decrease. Conversely,\nand Rate rates generally increase when reactant concentrations increase. So, rate of\nConstant a reaction depends upon the concentration of reactants.\nChemistry 66\nReprint 2025-26\nConsider a general reaction\naA + bB fi cC + dD\nwhere a, b, c and d are the stoichiometric coefficients of reactants\nand products.\nThe rate expression for this reaction is\nRate (cid:181) [A]x [B]y (3.4)\nwhere exponents x and y may or may not be equal to the\nstoichiometric coefficients (a and b) of the reactants. Above equation\ncan also be written as\nRate = k [A]x [B]y (3.4a)\n[ ]\n- d R = k [ A ]x[ B ]y (3.4b)\ndt\nThis form of equation (3.4 b) is known as differential rate equation,\nwhere k is a proportionality constant called rate constant. The\nequation like (3.4), which relates the rate of a reaction to concentration\nof reactants is called rate law or rate expression. Thus, rate law is the\nexpression in which reaction rate is given in terms of molar\nconcentration of reactants with each term raised to some\npower, which may or may not be same as the stoichiometric\ncoefficient of the reacting species in a balanced chemical\nequation. For example:\n2NO(g) + O (g) fi 2NO (g)\n2 2\nWe can measure the rate of this reaction as a function of initial\nconcentrations either by keeping the concentration of one of the reactants\nconstant and changing the concentration of the other reactant or by\nchanging the concentration of both the reactants. The following results\nare obtained (Table 3.2).\nTable 3.2: Initial rate of formation of NO\n2\nExperiment Initial [NO]/ mol L-1 Initial [O ]/ mol L-1 Initial rate of\n2\nformation of NO / mol L-1s-1\n2\n1. 0.30 0.30 0.096\n2. 0.60 0.30 0.384\n3. 0.30 0.60 0.192\n4. 0.60 0.60 0.768\nIt is obvious, after looking at the results, that when the concentration\nof NO is doubled and that of O is kept constant then the initial rate\n2\nincreases by a factor of four from 0.096 to 0.384 mol L–1s–1. This\nindicates that the rate depends upon the square of the concentration of\nNO. When concentration of NO is kept constant and concentration of\nO is doubled the rate also gets doubled indicating that rate depends\n2\non concentration of O to the first power. Hence, the rate equation for\n2\nthis reaction will be\nRate = k [NO]2[O ]\n2\n67 Chemical Kinetics\nReprint 2025-26\nThe differential form of this rate expression is given as\n[ ]\n- d R = k [ NO ]2 [ O ]\ndt 2\nNow, we observe that for this reaction in the rate equation derived\nfrom the experimental data, the exponents of the concentration terms\nare the same as their stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced\nchemical equation.\nSome other examples are given below:\nReaction Experimental rate expression\n1. CHCl + Cl fi CCl + HCl Rate = k [CHCl ] [Cl ]1/2\n3 2 4 3 2\n2. CHCOOCH + HO fi CHCOOH + CHOH Rate = k[CH COOCH ]1 [H O]0\n3 2 5 2 3 2 5 3 2 5 2\nIn these reactions, the exponents of the concentration terms are not\nthe same as their stoichiometric coefficients. Thus, we can say that:\nRate law for any reaction cannot be predicted by merely looking at\nthe balanced chemical equation, i.e., theoretically but must be determined\nexperimentally.\n3.2.3 Order of a In the rate equation (3.4)\nReaction Rate = k [A]x [B]y\nx and y indicate how sensitive the rate is to the change in concentration\nof A and B. Sum of these exponents, i.e., x + y in (3.4) gives the overall\norder of a reaction whereas x and y represent the order with respect\nto the reactants A and B respectively.\nHence, the sum of powers of the concentration of the\nreactants in the rate law expression is called the order of that\nchemical reaction.\nOrder of a reaction can be 0, 1, 2, 3 and even a fraction. A zero\norder reaction means that the rate of reaction is independent of the\nconcentration of reactants.\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 33333.....33333 Calculate the overall order of a reaction which\nhas the rate expression\n(a) Rate = k [A]1/2 [B]3/2\n(b) Rate = k [A]3/2 [B]–1\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\n(a) Rate = k [A]x [B]y\norder = x + y\nSo order = 1/2 + 3/2 = 2, i.e., second order\n(b) order = 3/2 + (–1) = 1/2, i.e., half order.\nA balanced chemical equation never gives us a true picture of how\na reaction takes place since rarely a reaction gets completed in one\nstep. The reactions taking place in one step are called elementary\nreactions. When a sequence of elementary reactions (called mechanism)\ngives us the products, the reactions are called complex reactions.\nChemistry 68\nReprint 2025-26\nThese may be consecutive reactions (e.g., oxidation of ethane to CO\n2\nand H O passes through a series of intermediate steps in which alcohol,\n2\naldehyde and acid are formed), reverse reactions and side reactions\n(e.g., nitration of phenol yields o-nitrophenol and p-nitrophenol).\nUnits of rate constant\nFor a general reaction\naA + bB fi cC + dD\nRate = k [A]x [B]y\nWhere x + y = n = order of the reaction\nRate\nk =\n[A]x[B]y\n= concentration × 1 ( where [A]=[B] )\ntime ( concentration )n\nTaking SI units of concentration, mol L–1 and time, s, the units of\nk for different reaction order are listed in Table 3.3\nTable 3.3: Units of rate constant\nReaction Order Units of rate constant\nmolL- 1 1\n· =molL- 1s- 1\nZero order reaction 0 s ( molL- 1 )0\nmolL - 1 1\n· = s - 1\nFirst order reaction 1 s ( molL - 1 ) 1\nmolL - 1 1\n· = mol - 1Ls - 1\nSecond order reaction 2 s ( molL - 1 ) 2\nIdentify the reaction order from each of the following rate constants.

The number of reacting species\nReaction (atoms, ions or molecules) taking part in an elementary\nreaction, which must collide simultaneously in order to bring\nabout a chemical reaction is called molecularity of a reaction.\nThe reaction can be unimolecular when one reacting species is involved,\nfor example, decomposition of ammonium nitrite.\n69 Chemical Kinetics\nReprint 2025-26\nNH NO fi N + 2H O\n4 2 2 2\nBimolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision between two\nspecies, for example, dissociation of hydrogen iodide.\n2HI fi H + I\n2 2\nTrimolecular or termolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision\nbetween three reacting species, for example,\n2NO + O fi 2NO\n2 2\nThe probability that more than three molecules can collide and\nreact simultaneously is very small. Hence, reactions with the\nmolecularity three are very rare and slow to proceed.\nIt is, therefore, evident that complex reactions involving more than\nthree molecules in the stoichiometric equation must take place in more\nthan one step.\nKClO + 6FeSO + 3H SO fi KCl + 3Fe (SO ) + 3H O\n3 4 2 4 2 4 3 2\nThis reaction which apparently seems to be of tenth order is actually\na second order reaction. This shows that this reaction takes place in\nseveral steps. Which step controls the rate of the overall reaction? The\nquestion can be answered if we go through the mechanism of reaction,\nfor example, chances to win the relay race competition by a team\ndepend upon the slowest person in the team. Similarly, the overall rate\nof the reaction is controlled by the slowest step in a reaction called the\nrate determining step. Consider the decomposition of hydrogen\nperoxide which is catalysed by iodide ion in an alkaline medium.\nI-\n2H O  2H O + O\n2 2 Alkaline medium 2 2\nThe rate equation for this reaction is found to be\ndH O \nRate  2 2 kH O  I\ndt 2 2\nThis reaction is first order with respect to both H O and I–. Evidences\n2 2\nsuggest that this reaction takes place in two steps\n(1) H O + I– fi H O + IO–\n2 2 2\n(2) H O + IO– fi H O + I– + O\n2 2 2 2\nBoth the steps are bimolecular elementary reactions. Species IO- is\ncalled as an intermediate since it is formed during the course of the\nreaction but not in the overall balanced equation. The first step, being\nslow, is the rate determining step. Thus, the rate of formation of\nintermediate will determine the rate of this reaction.\nThus, from the discussion, till now, we conclude the following:\n(i) Order of a reaction is an experimental quantity. It can be zero and\neven a fraction but molecularity cannot be zero or a non integer.\n(ii) Order is applicable to elementary as well as complex reactions\nwhereas molecularity is applicable only for elementary reactions.\nFor complex reaction molecularity has no meaning.\nChemistry 70\nReprint 2025-26\n(iii) For complex reaction, order is given by the slowest step and\nmolecularity of the slowest step is same as the order of the overall\nreaction.\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n3.3 For a reaction, A + B fi Product; the rate law is given by, r = k [ A]1/2 [B]2.\nWhat is the order of the reaction?\n3.4 The conversion of molecules X to Y follows second order kinetics.

This makes it difficult to determine the rate law and hence\nthe order of the reaction. In order to avoid this difficulty, we can\nintegrate the differential rate equation to give a relation between directly\nmeasured experimental data, i.e., concentrations at different times\nand rate constant.\nThe integrated rate equations are different for the reactions of different\nreaction orders. We shall determine these equations only for zero and\nfirst order chemical reactions.\n3.3.1 Zero Order Zero order reaction means that the rate of the reaction is proportional\nReactions to zero power of the concentration of reactants.

Since it is difficult to predict the energy vs reaction coordinate\nbehaviour of any one molecule with\nprecision, Ludwig Boltzmann and James\nClark Maxwell used statistics to predict\nthe behaviour of large number of\nmolecules. According to them, the\ndistribution of kinetic energy may be\ndescribed by plotting the fraction of\nmolecules (N /N ) with a given kinetic\nE T\nenergy (E) vs kinetic energy (Fig. 3.8).\nHere, N is the number of molecules with\nE\nenergy E and N is total number\nT\nof molecules.\nThe peak of the curve corresponds to\nthe most probable kinetic energy, i.e.,\nkinetic energy of maximum fraction of\nmolecules.

When the\n79 Chemical Kinetics\nReprint 2025-26\ntemperature is raised, the maximum\nof the curve moves to the higher\nenergy value (Fig. 3.9) and the curve\nbroadens out, i.e., spreads to the right\nsuch that there is a greater proportion\nof molecules with much higher\nenergies.

The substance is then called inhibitor. The\naction of the catalyst can be explained by intermediate complex theory.\nAccording to this theory, a catalyst participates in a chemical reaction by\nforming temporary bonds with the reactants resulting in an intermediate\ncomplex. This has a transitory existence and decomposes to yield products\nand the catalyst.\nIt is believed that the catalyst provides an\nalternate pathway or reaction mechanism by\nreducing the activation energy between\nreactants and products and hence lowering\nthe potential energy barrier as shown in\nFig. 3.11.\nIt is clear from Arrhenius equation (3.18)\nthat lower the value of activation energy faster\nwill be the rate of a reaction.\nA small amount of the catalyst can catalyse\na large amount of reactants. A catalyst does\nFig. 3.11:Effect of catalyst on activation\nenergy not alter Gibbs energy, DG of a reaction. It\ncatalyses the spontaneous reactions but does\nnot catalyse non-spontaneous reactions. It is\nalso found that a catalyst does not change the equilibrium constant of\na reaction rather, it helps in attaining the equilibrium faster, that is, it\ncatalyses the forward as well as the backward reactions to the same\nextent so that the equilibrium state remains same but is reached earlier.\n33333.....55555 CCCCCooooolllllllllliiiiisssssiiiiiooooonnnnn\nThough Arrhenius equation is applicable under a wide range of\nTTTTThhhhheeeeeooooorrrrryyyyy ooooofffff circumstances, collision theory, which was developed by Max Trautz\nand William Lewis in 1916 -18, provides a greater insight into the\nCCCCChhhhheeeeemmmmmiiiiicccccaaaaalllll\nenergetic and mechanistic aspects of reactions.

According to this theory, the reactant molecules are\nChemistry 82\nReprint 2025-26\nassumed to be hard spheres and reaction is postulated to occur when\nmolecules collide with each other. The number of collisions per\nsecond per unit volume of the reaction mixture is known as\ncollision frequency (Z). Another factor which affects the rate of\nchemical reactions is activation energy (as we have already studied).\nFor a bimolecular elementary reaction\nA + B fi Products\nrate of reaction can be expressed as\nRate = Z e - Ea/RT (3.23)\nAB\nwhere Z represents the collision frequency of reactants, A and B\nAB\nand e-Ea /RT represents the fraction of molecules with energies equal to\nor greater than E . Comparing (3.23) with Arrhenius equation, we can\na\nsay that A is related to collision frequency.\nEquation (3.23) predicts the value of rate constants fairly\naccurately for the reactions that involve atomic species or simple\nmolecules but for complex molecules significant deviations are\nobserved. The reason could be that all collisions do not lead to the\nformation of products. The collisions in which molecules collide with\nsufficient kinetic energy (called threshold energy*) and proper\norientation, so as to facilitate breaking of bonds between reacting\nspecies and formation of new bonds to form products are called as\neffective collisions.\nFor example, formation of\nmethanol from bromoethane depends\nupon the orientation of reactant\nmolecules as shown in\nFig. 3.12. The proper orientation of\nreactant molecules lead to bond\nformation whereas improper\norientation makes them simply\nbounce back and no products are\nformed.\nFig. 3.12:Diagram showing molecules having proper and\nTo account for effective collisions, improper orientation\nanother factor P, called the probability\nor steric factor is introduced. It takes into account the fact that in a\ncollision, molecules must be properly oriented i.e.,\nRate = PZ e - Ea/RT\nAB\nThus, in collision theory activation energy and proper orientation of\nthe molecules together determine the criteria for an effective collision\nand hence the rate of a chemical reaction.\nCollision theory also has certain drawbacks as it considers atoms/\nmolecules to be hard spheres and ignores their structural aspect. You\nwill study details about this theory and more on other theories in your\nhigher classes.\n* Threshold energy = Activation Energy + energy possessed by reacting species.\n83 Chemical Kinetics\nReprint 2025-26\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n3.7 What will be the effect of temperature on rate constant ?\n3.8 The rate of the chemical reaction doubles for an increase of 10K in absolute\ntemperature from 298K.

The rate of a reaction is concerned with decrease in concentration\nof reactants or increase in the concentration of products per unit time. It can\nbe expressed as instantaneous rate at a particular instant of time and average\nrate over a large interval of time. A number of factors such as temperature,\nconcentration of reactants, catalyst, affect the rate of a reaction. Mathematical\nrepresentation of rate of a reaction is given by rate law. It has to be determined\nexperimentally and cannot be predicted. Order of a reaction with respect to\na reactant is the power of its concentration which appears in the rate law\nequation. The order of a reaction is the sum of all such powers of concentration\nof terms for different reactants. Rate constant is the proportionality factor in\nthe rate law. Rate constant and order of a reaction can be determined from rate\nlaw or its integrated rate equation. Molecularity is defined only for an elementary\nreaction. Its values are limited from 1 to 3 whereas order can be 0, 1, 2, 3 or\neven a fraction.

Express the rate of a reaction in terms of change in concentration Chemistry, by its very nature, is concerned with change. Of either of the reactants or Substances with well defined properties are converted products with time; by chemical reactions into other substances with distinguish between elementary different properties. For any chemical reaction, chemists and complex reactions; try to find out differentiate between the(a) the feasibility of a chemical reaction which can be molecularity and order of a predicted by thermodynamics(as you know that a reaction; reaction with DG < 0, at constant temperature and define rate constant; pressure is feasible); discuss the dependence of rate of reactions on concentration,(b) extent to which a reaction will proceed can be temperature and catalyst; determined from chemical equilibrium; derive integrated rate equations(c) speed of a reaction i. e. Time taken by a reaction to for the zero and first order reach equilibrium. Reactions; Along with feasibility and extent, it is equally determine the rate constants for important to know the rate and the factors controlling zeroth and first order reactions; the rate of a chemical reaction for its complete describe collision theory. Understanding. For example, which parameters determine as to how rapidly food gets spoiled? How to design a rapidly setting material for dental filling? Or what controls the rate at which fuel burns in an auto engine? All these questions can be answered by the branch of chemistry, which deals with the study of reaction rates and their mechanisms, called chemical kinetics. The word kinetics is derived from the Greek word kinesis meaning movement. Thermodynamics tells only about the feasibility of a reaction whereas chemical kinetics tells about the rate of a reaction. For example, thermodynamic data indicate that diamond shall convert to graphite but in reality the conversion rate is so slow that the change is not perceptible at all. Therefore, most people think Reprint 2025 - 26 that diamond is forever. Kinetic studies not only help us to determine the speed or rate of a chemical reaction but also describe the conditions by which the reaction rates can be altered. The factors such as concentration, temperature, pressure and catalyst affect the rate of a reaction. At the macroscopic level, we are interested in amounts reacted or formed and the rates of their consumption or formation. At the molecular level, the reaction mechanisms involving orientation and energy of molecules undergoing collisions, are discussed. In this Unit, we shall be dealing with average and instantaneous rate of reaction and the factors affecting these. Some elementary ideas about the collision theory of reaction rates are also given. However, in order to understand all these, let us first learn about the reaction rate. 33333. 11111 Rate of a Some reactions such as ionic reactions occur very fast, for example, Chemical precipitation of silver chloride occurs instantaneously by mixing of aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and sodium chloride. On the other Reaction hand, some reactions are very slow, for example, rusting of iron in the presence of air and moisture. Also there are reactions like inversion of cane sugar and hydrolysis of starch, which proceed with a moderate speed. Can you think of more examples from each category? You must be knowing that speed of an automobile is expressed in terms of change in the position or distance covered by it in a certain period of time. Similarly, the speed of a reaction or the rate of a reaction can be defined as the change in concentration of a reactant or product in unit time. To be more specific, it can be expressed in terms of:(i) the rate of decrease in concentration of any one of the reactants, or(ii) the rate of increase in concentration of any one of the products. Consider a hypothetical reaction, assuming that the volume of the system remains constant. R fi P One mole of the reactant R produces one mole of the product P. If[R] and[P] are the concentrations of R and P respectively at time t 1 1 1 and[R] and[P] are their concentrations at time t then, 2 2 2 Dt = t t 2 1 D[R] =[R][R] 2 1 D[P] =[P][P] 2 1 The square brackets in the above expressions are used to express molar concentration. Rate of disappearance of R Decrease in concentration of R D[R] = = -(3. 1) Time taken D t Chemistry 62 Reprint 2025 - 26 Rate of appearance of P Increase in concentration of P D[P] = = +(3. 2) Time taken D t Since, D[R] is a negative quantity(as concentration of reactants is decreasing), it is multiplied with 1 to make the rate of the reaction a positive quantity. Equations(3. 1) and(3. 2) given above represent the average rate of a reaction, r. Av Average rate depends upon the change in concentration of reactants or products and the time taken for that change to occur(Fig. 3. 1). {} Fig. 3. 1: Instantaneous and average rate of a reaction Units of rate of a reaction From equations(3. 1) and(3. 2), it is clear that units of rate are concentration time 1. For example, if concentration is in mol L 1 and time is in seconds then the units will be mol L - 1s 1. However, in gaseous reactions, when the concentration of gases is expressed in terms of their partial pressures, then the units of the rate equation will be atm s 1. From the concentrations of C H Cl(butyl chloride) at different times given Example 33333. 11111 4 9 below, calculate the average rate of the reaction: C H Cl + H O fi C H OH + Hcl 4 9 2 4 9 during different intervals of time.

However, average rate cannot be used to predict the rate of a reaction at a particular instant as it would be constant for the time interval for which it is calculated. So, to express the rate at a particular moment of time we determine the instantaneous rate. It is obtained when we consider the average rate at the smallest time interval say dt(i. e. When Dt approaches zero). Hence, mathematically for an infinitesimally small dt instantaneous rate is given by - D[] D[] R P r = =(3. 3) av D t D t d R d P As Dt fi 0 or r inst dt dt Fig 3. 2 Instantaneous rate of hydrolysis of butyl chloride(C H Cl) 4 9 Chemistry 64 Reprint 2025 - 26 It can be determined graphically by drawing a tangent at time t on either of the curves for concentration of R and P vs time t and calculating its slope(Fig. 3. 1). So in problem 3. 1, r at 600s for example, can be inst calculated by plotting concentration of butyl chloride as a function of time. A tangent is drawn that touches the curve at t = 600 s(Fig. 3. 2). The slope of this tangent gives the instantaneous rate. So, r at 600 s = mol L 1 = 5. 12 × 10 5 mol L 1s 1 inst At t = 250 s r = 1. 22 × 10 4mol L 1s 1 inst t = 350 s r = 1. 0 × 10 4 mol L 1s 1 inst t = 450 s r = 6. 4 × × 10 5 mol L 1s 1 inst Now consider a reaction Hg(l) + Cl(g) Fihgcl(s) 2 2 Where stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants and products are same, then rate of the reaction is given as[][][] D Hg D Cl D Hgcl Rate of reaction = = 2 = 2 D t D t D t i. e., rate of disappearance of any of the reactants is same as the rate of appearance of the products. But in the following reaction, two moles of HI decompose to produce one mole each of H and I 2 2, 2HI(g) fi H(g) + I(g) 2 2 For expressing the rate of such a reaction where stoichiometric coefficients of reactants or products are not equal to one, rate of disappearance of any of the reactants or the rate of appearance of products is divided by their respective stoichiometric coefficients. Since rate of consumption of HI is twice the rate of formation of H or I, to 2 2 make them equal, the term D[HI] is divided by 2. The rate of this reaction is given by = - 1 D[HI] = D[H 2] = D[I 2] Rate of reaction 2 D t D t D t Similarly, for the reaction 5 Br -(aq) + Bro(aq) + 6 H +(aq) fi 3 Br(aq) + 3 H O(l) 3 2 2 Rate = - 1 D[Br -] = - D Ø o Bro 3 - ø ß = - 1 D[H +] = 1 D[Br 2] = 1 D[H 2 OO] 5 D t D t 6 D t 3 D t 3 D t For a gaseous reaction at constant temperature, concentration is directly proportional to the partial pressure of a species and hence, rate can also be expressed as rate of change in partial pressure of the reactant or the product. 65 Chemical Kinetics Reprint 2025 - 26 Example 33333. 22222 The decomposition of N O in Ccl at 318K has been studied by 2 5 4 monitoring the concentration of N O in the solution.

Calculate the rate during this interval? 33333. 22222 Factors Influencing Rate of reaction depends upon the experimental conditions such Rate of a Reaction as concentration of reactants(pressure in case of gases), temperature and catalyst. 3. 2. 1 Dependence The rate of a chemical reaction at a given temperature may depend on of Rate on the concentration of one or more reactants and products. The Concentration representation of rate of reaction in terms of concentration of the reactants is known as rate law. It is also called as rate equation or rate expression. 3. 2. 2 Rate The results in Table 3. 1 clearly show that rate of a reaction decreases with Expression the passage of time as the concentration of reactants decrease. Conversely, and Rate rates generally increase when reactant concentrations increase. So, rate of Constant a reaction depends upon the concentration of reactants. Chemistry 66 Reprint 2025 - 26 Consider a general reaction Aa + Bb fi Cc + Dd where a, b, c and d are the stoichiometric coefficients of reactants and products. The rate expression for this reaction is Rate(cid: 181)[A] x[B] y(3. 4) where exponents x and y may or may not be equal to the stoichiometric coefficients(a and b) of the reactants. Above equation can also be written as Rate = k[A] x[B] y(3. 4a)[] - d R = k[A] x[B] y(3. 4b) dt This form of equation(3. 4 b) is known as differential rate equation, where k is a proportionality constant called rate constant. The equation like(3. 4), which relates the rate of a reaction to concentration of reactants is called rate law or rate expression. Thus, rate law is the expression in which reaction rate is given in terms of molar concentration of reactants with each term raised to some power, which may or may not be same as the stoichiometric coefficient of the reacting species in a balanced chemical equation. For example: 2NO(g) + O(g) fi 2NO(g) 2 2 We can measure the rate of this reaction as a function of initial concentrations either by keeping the concentration of one of the reactants constant and changing the concentration of the other reactant or by changing the concentration of both the reactants. The following results are obtained(Table 3. 2). Table 3. 2: Initial rate of formation of NO 2 Experiment Initial[NO] / mol L - 1 Initial[O] / mol L - 1 Initial rate of 2 formation of NO / mol L - 1s - 1 2 1. 0. 30 0. 30 0. 096 2. 0. 60 0. 30 0. 384 3. 0. 30 0. 60 0. 192 4. 0. 60 0. 60 0. 768 It is obvious, after looking at the results, that when the concentration of NO is doubled and that of O is kept constant then the initial rate 2 increases by a factor of four from 0. 096 to 0. 384 mol L 1s 1. This indicates that the rate depends upon the square of the concentration of NO. When concentration of NO is kept constant and concentration of O is doubled the rate also gets doubled indicating that rate depends 2 on concentration of O to the first power. Hence, the rate equation for 2 this reaction will be Rate = k[NO] 2[O] 2 67 Chemical Kinetics Reprint 2025 - 26 The differential form of this rate expression is given as[] - d R = k[NO] 2[O] dt 2 Now, we observe that for this reaction in the rate equation derived from the experimental data, the exponents of the concentration terms are the same as their stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced chemical equation. Some other examples are given below: Reaction Experimental rate expression 1. CHCl + Cl fi Ccl + Hcl Rate = k[CHCl][Cl] 1 / 2 3 2 4 3 2 2. CHCOOCH + HO fi CHCOOH + CHOH Rate = k[CH COOCH] 1[H O] 0 3 2 5 2 3 2 5 3 2 5 2 In these reactions, the exponents of the concentration terms are not the same as their stoichiometric coefficients. Thus, we can say that: Rate law for any reaction cannot be predicted by merely looking at the balanced chemical equation, i. e., theoretically but must be determined experimentally. 3. 2. 3 Order of a In the rate equation(3. 4) Reaction Rate = k[A] x[B] y x and y indicate how sensitive the rate is to the change in concentration of A and B. Sum of these exponents, i. e., x + y in(3. 4) gives the overall order of a reaction whereas x and y represent the order with respect to the reactants A and B respectively. Hence, the sum of powers of the concentration of the reactants in the rate law expression is called the order of that chemical reaction. Order of a reaction can be 0, 1, 2, 3 and even a fraction. A zero order reaction means that the rate of reaction is independent of the concentration of reactants. Example 33333. 33333 Calculate the overall order of a reaction which has the rate expression(a) Rate = k[A] 1 / 2[B] 3 / 2(b) Rate = k[A] 3 / 2[B] 1 Solution(a) Rate = k[A] x[B] y order = x + y So order = 1 / 2 + 3 / 2 = 2, i. e., second order(b) order = 3 / 2 +(1) = 1 / 2, i. e., half order. A balanced chemical equation never gives us a true picture of how a reaction takes place since rarely a reaction gets completed in one step. The reactions taking place in one step are called elementary reactions. When a sequence of elementary reactions(called mechanism) gives us the products, the reactions are called complex reactions.

The number of reacting species Reaction(atoms, ions or molecules) taking part in an elementary reaction, which must collide simultaneously in order to bring about a chemical reaction is called molecularity of a reaction. The reaction can be unimolecular when one reacting species is involved, for example, decomposition of ammonium nitrite. 69 Chemical Kinetics Reprint 2025 - 26 NH NO fi N + 2H O 4 2 2 2 Bimolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision between two species, for example, dissociation of hydrogen iodide. 2HI fi H + I 2 2 Trimolecular or termolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision between three reacting species, for example, 2NO + O fi 2NO 2 2 The probability that more than three molecules can collide and react simultaneously is very small. Hence, reactions with the molecularity three are very rare and slow to proceed. It is, therefore, evident that complex reactions involving more than three molecules in the stoichiometric equation must take place in more than one step. KClO + 6FeSO + 3H SO fi Kcl + 3Fe(SO) + 3H O 3 4 2 4 2 4 3 2 This reaction which apparently seems to be of tenth order is actually a second order reaction. This shows that this reaction takes place in several steps. Which step controls the rate of the overall reaction? The question can be answered if we go through the mechanism of reaction, for example, chances to win the relay race competition by a team depend upon the slowest person in the team. Similarly, the overall rate of the reaction is controlled by the slowest step in a reaction called the rate determining step. Consider the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide which is catalysed by iodide ion in an alkaline medium. I - 2H O 2H O + O 2 2 Alkaline medium 2 2 The rate equation for this reaction is found to be d H O Rate 2 2 k H O I dt 2 2 This reaction is first order with respect to both H O and I. Evidences 2 2 suggest that this reaction takes place in two steps(1) H O + I fi H O + IO 2 2 2(2) H O + IO fi H O + I + O 2 2 2 2 Both the steps are bimolecular elementary reactions. Species IO - is called as an intermediate since it is formed during the course of the reaction but not in the overall balanced equation. The first step, being slow, is the rate determining step. Thus, the rate of formation of intermediate will determine the rate of this reaction. Thus, from the discussion, till now, we conclude the following:(i) Order of a reaction is an experimental quantity. It can be zero and even a fraction but molecularity cannot be zero or a non integer.(ii) Order is applicable to elementary as well as complex reactions whereas molecularity is applicable only for elementary reactions. For complex reaction molecularity has no meaning. Chemistry 70 Reprint 2025 - 26(i) For complex reaction, order is given by the slowest step and molecularity of the slowest step is same as the order of the overall reaction. Intext Questions 3. 3 For a reaction, A + B fi Product; the rate law is given by, r = k[A] 1 / 2[B] 2. What is the order of the reaction? 3. 4 The conversion of molecules X to Y follows second order kinetics. If concentration of X is increased to three times how will it affect the rate of formation of Y? 33333. 33333 Integrated We have already noted that the concentration dependence of rate is called differential rate equation. It is not always convenient to Rate determine the instantaneous rate, as it is measured by determination Equations of slope of the tangent at point t in concentration vs time plot(Fig. 3. 1). This makes it difficult to determine the rate law and hence the order of the reaction. In order to avoid this difficulty, we can integrate the differential rate equation to give a relation between directly measured experimental data, i. e., concentrations at different times and rate constant. The integrated rate equations are different for the reactions of different reaction orders. We shall determine these equations only for zero and first order chemical reactions. 3. 3. 1 Zero Order Zero order reaction means that the rate of the reaction is proportional Reactions to zero power of the concentration of reactants. Consider the reaction, R fi P d R Rate = k R 0 dt As any quantity raised to power zero is unity d R Rate = k × 1 dt d[R] = k dt Integrating both sides[R] = k t + I(3. 5) where, I is the constant of integration. At t = 0, the concentration of the reactant R =[R], where[R] is 0 0 initial concentration of the reactant.

Some enzyme catalysed reactions and reactions which occur on metal surfaces are a few examples of zero order 0 reactions.

At high pressure, the metal surface gets saturated with gas molecules. So, a further change in reaction conditions is unable to alter the amount of ammonia on the surface of the catalyst making rate of the reaction independent of its concentration. The thermal decomposition of HI on gold surface is another example of zero order reaction. 3. 3. 2 First Order In this class of reactions, the rate of the reaction is proportional to the Reactions first power of the concentration of the reactant R. For example, R fi P[] Rate = - d R = k[R] dt[] d R or[] = kdt R Integrating this equation, we get ln[R] = kt + I(3. 8) Again, I is the constant of integration and its value can be determined easily.

Therefore, equation(3. 8) can be written as ln[R] = k × 0 + I 0 ln[R] = I 0 Substituting the value of I in equation(3. 8) ln[R] = kt + ln[R](3. 9) 0 Reprint 2025 - 26 Rearranging this equation[] R ln = - kt[] R 0 1 R or k ln 0(3. 10) t R At time t from equation(3. 8) 1 * ln[R] = kt + * ln[R](3. 11) 1 1 0 At time t 2 ln[R] = kt + ln[R](3. 12) 2 2 0 where,[R] and[R] are the concentrations of the reactants at time 1 2 t and t respectively. 1 2 Subtracting(3. 12) from(3. 11) ln[R] ln[R] = kt(kt) 1 2 1 2[] ln R 1 = k(t - t)[] 2 1 R 2[] 1 R k =(t - t) ln[R] 1(3. 13) 2 1 2 Equation(3. 9) can also be written as[] R ln = - kt[] R 0 Taking antilog of both sides[R] =[R] e kt(3. 14) 0 Comparing equation(3. 9) with y = mx + c, if we plot ln[R] against t(Fig. 3. 4) we get a straight line with slope = k and intercept equal to ln[R] 0 The first order rate equation(3. 10) can also be written in the form[] 2. 303 R k = log[] 0(3. 15) t R[] R kt * log 0 =[] R 2. 303 If we plot a graph between log[R] /[R] vs t,(Fig. 3. 5), 0 the slope = k / 2. 303 Hydrogenation of ethene is an example of first order reaction.

There are many reactions which obey first order rate law although they are higher order reactions. Consider the hydrolysis of ethyl acetate which is a chemical reaction between ethyl acetate and water. In reality, it is a second order reaction and concentration of both ethyl acetate and water affect the rate of the reaction. But water is taken in large excess for hydrolysis, therefore, concentration of water is not altered much during the reaction. Thus, the rate of reaction is affected by concentration of ethyl acetate only. For example, during the hydrolysis of 0. 01 mol of ethyl acetate with 10 mol of water, amounts of the reactants and products at the beginning(t = 0) and completion(t) of the reaction are given as under.

How long will 5 g of this reactant take to reduce to 3 g? 3. 6 Time required to decompose SO Cl to half of its initial amount is 60 2 2 minutes. If the decomposition is a first order reaction, calculate the rate constant of the reaction. Most of the chemical reactions are accelerated by increase in temperature. 33333. 44444 Temperature For example, in decomposition of N O, the time taken for half of the Dependence of original amount of material to deco 2 mp 5 ose is 12 min at 50oC, 5 h at the Rate of a 25oC and 10 days at 0oC. You also know that in a mixture of potassium permanganate(KMnO) and oxalic acid(H C O), potassium Reaction 4 2 2 4 permanganate gets decolourised faster at a higher temperature than that at a lower temperature. It has been found that for a chemical reaction with rise in temperature by 10 °, the rate constant is nearly doubled. The temperature dependence of the rate of a chemical reaction can be accurately explained by Arrhenius equation(3. 18). It was first proposed by Dutch chemist, J. H. Van t Hoff but Swedish chemist, Arrhenius provided its physical justification and interpretation. Chemistry 78 Reprint 2025 - 26 k = A e - Ea / RT(3. 18) where A is the Arrhenius factor or the frequency factor. It is also called pre - exponential factor. It is a constant specific to a particular reaction. R is gas constant and E is activation energy measured in joules / mole a(J mol 1). It can be understood clearly using the following simple reaction H g I g 2HI g 2 2 According to Arrhenius, this reaction can take place only when a molecule of hydrogen and a molecule of iodine Intermediate collide to form an unstable intermediate(Fig. 3. 6). It exists for a very short time and then breaks up to form two Fig. 3. 6: Formation of HI through molecules of hydrogen iodide. The intermediate The energy required to form this intermediate, called activated complex(C), is known as activation energy(E). A Fig. 3. 7 is obtained by plotting potential energy vs reaction coordinate. Reaction coordinate represents the profile of energy change when reactants change into products. Some energy is released when the complex decomposes to form products. So, the final enthalpy of the reaction depends upon the nature of reactants and products. All the molecules in the reacting species do not have the same kinetic Fig. 3. 7: Diagram showing plot of potential energy. Since it is difficult to predict the energy vs reaction coordinate behaviour of any one molecule with precision, Ludwig Boltzmann and James Clark Maxwell used statistics to predict the behaviour of large number of molecules. According to them, the distribution of kinetic energy may be described by plotting the fraction of molecules(N / N) with a given kinetic E T energy(E) vs kinetic energy(Fig. 3. 8). Here, N is the number of molecules with E energy E and N is total number T of molecules. The peak of the curve corresponds to the most probable kinetic energy, i. e., kinetic energy of maximum fraction of molecules. There are decreasing number Fig. 3. 8: Distribution curve showing energies of molecules with energies higher or among gaseous molecules lower than this value. When the 79 Chemical Kinetics Reprint 2025 - 26 temperature is raised, the maximum of the curve moves to the higher energy value(Fig. 3. 9) and the curve broadens out, i. e., spreads to the right such that there is a greater proportion of molecules with much higher energies. The area under the curve must be constant since total probability must be one at all times. We can mark the position of E on a Fig. 3. 9: Distribution curve showing temperature Maxwell Boltzmann distribution curve dependence of rate of a reaction(Fig. 3. 9). Increasing the temperature of the substance increases the fraction of molecules, which collide with energies greater than E. It is clear a from the diagram that in the curve at(t + 10), the area showing the fraction of molecules having energy equal to or greater than activation energy gets doubled leading to doubling the rate of a reaction. In the Arrhenius equation(3. 18) the factor e - Ea / Rtcorresponds to the fraction of molecules that have kinetic energy greater than E. A Taking natural logarithm of both sides of equation(3. 18) E ln k = a + ln A(3. 19) RT The plot of ln k vs 1 / T gives a straight line according to the equation(3. 19) as shown in Fig. 3. 10. Thus, it has been found from Arrhenius equation(3. 18) that increasing the temperature or decreasing the activation energy will result in an increase in the rate of the reaction and an exponential increase in the rate constant. E In Fig. 3. 10, slope = a and intercept = ln R A. So we can calculate E and A using these values. A At temperature T, equation(3. 19) is 1 E a ln k = + ln A(3. 20) 1 RT 1 At temperature T, equation(3. 19) is 2 E a ln k = + ln A(3. 21) 2 RT 2(since A is constant for a given reaction) k and k are the values of rate constants at 1 2 temperatures T and T respectively. 1 2 Fig. 3. 10: A plot between ln k and 1 / T Chemistry 80 Reprint 2025 - 26 Subtracting equation(3. 20) from(3. 21), we obtain E E a a ln k ln k = 2 1 RT RT 1 2 k E Ø 1 1 ø ln 2 = a Œ - œ k R o T T ß 1 1 2 k E Ø 1 1 ø log 2 = a Œ - œ(3. 22) k 2. 303R o T T ß 1 1 2 k E Ø T - T ø log 2 = a Œ 2 1 œ k 2. 303R o T T ß 1 1 2 Example 33333. 99999 The rate constants of a reaction at 500K and 700K are 0. 02s 1 and 0. 07s 1 respectively.

For example, Mno 2 catalyses the following reaction so as to increase its rate considerably. 2KClO Mn O 2 2 Kcl + 3O 3 2 The word catalyst should not be used when the added substance reduces the rate of raction. The substance is then called inhibitor. The action of the catalyst can be explained by intermediate complex theory. According to this theory, a catalyst participates in a chemical reaction by forming temporary bonds with the reactants resulting in an intermediate complex. This has a transitory existence and decomposes to yield products and the catalyst. It is believed that the catalyst provides an alternate pathway or reaction mechanism by reducing the activation energy between reactants and products and hence lowering the potential energy barrier as shown in Fig. 3. 11. It is clear from Arrhenius equation(3. 18) that lower the value of activation energy faster will be the rate of a reaction. A small amount of the catalyst can catalyse a large amount of reactants. A catalyst does Fig. 3. 11: Effect of catalyst on activation energy not alter Gibbs energy, DG of a reaction. It catalyses the spontaneous reactions but does not catalyse non - spontaneous reactions. It is also found that a catalyst does not change the equilibrium constant of a reaction rather, it helps in attaining the equilibrium faster, that is, it catalyses the forward as well as the backward reactions to the same extent so that the equilibrium state remains same but is reached earlier. 33333. 55555 Colision Though Arrhenius equation is applicable under a wide range of Theory of circumstances, collision theory, which was developed by Max Trautz and William Lewis in 1916 - 18, provides a greater insight into the Chemical energetic and mechanistic aspects of reactions. It is based on kinetic Reactions theory of gases. According to this theory, the reactant molecules are Chemistry 82 Reprint 2025 - 26 assumed to be hard spheres and reaction is postulated to occur when molecules collide with each other. The number of collisions per second per unit volume of the reaction mixture is known as collision frequency(Z). Another factor which affects the rate of chemical reactions is activation energy(as we have already studied). For a bimolecular elementary reaction A + B fi Products rate of reaction can be expressed as Rate = Z e - Ea / RT(3. 23) AB where Z represents the collision frequency of reactants, A and B AB and e - Ea / RT represents the fraction of molecules with energies equal to or greater than E. Comparing(3. 23) with Arrhenius equation, we can a say that A is related to collision frequency. Equation(3. 23) predicts the value of rate constants fairly accurately for the reactions that involve atomic species or simple molecules but for complex molecules significant deviations are observed. The reason could be that all collisions do not lead to the formation of products. The collisions in which molecules collide with sufficient kinetic energy(called threshold energy *) and proper orientation, so as to facilitate breaking of bonds between reacting species and formation of new bonds to form products are called as effective collisions. For example, formation of methanol from bromoethane depends upon the orientation of reactant molecules as shown in Fig. 3. 12. The proper orientation of reactant molecules lead to bond formation whereas improper orientation makes them simply bounce back and no products are formed. Fig. 3. 12: Diagram showing molecules having proper and To account for effective collisions, improper orientation another factor P, called the probability or steric factor is introduced. It takes into account the fact that in a collision, molecules must be properly oriented i. e., Rate = PZ e - Ea / RT AB Thus, in collision theory activation energy and proper orientation of the molecules together determine the criteria for an effective collision and hence the rate of a chemical reaction. Collision theory also has certain drawbacks as it considers atoms / molecules to be hard spheres and ignores their structural aspect. You will study details about this theory and more on other theories in your higher classes. * Threshold energy = Activation Energy + energy possessed by reacting species. 83 Chemical Kinetics Reprint 2025 - 26 Intext Questions 3. 7 What will be the effect of temperature on rate constant? 3. 8 The rate of the chemical reaction doubles for an increase of 10K in absolute temperature from 298K.

Calculate the fraction of molecules of reactants having energy equal to or greater than activation energy? Sumary Chemical kinetics is the study of chemical reactions with respect to reaction rates, effect of various variables, rearrangement of atoms and formation of intermediates. The rate of a reaction is concerned with decrease in concentration of reactants or increase in the concentration of products per unit time. It can be expressed as instantaneous rate at a particular instant of time and average rate over a large interval of time. A number of factors such as temperature, concentration of reactants, catalyst, affect the rate of a reaction. Mathematical representation of rate of a reaction is given by rate law. It has to be determined experimentally and cannot be predicted. Order of a reaction with respect to a reactant is the power of its concentration which appears in the rate law equation. The order of a reaction is the sum of all such powers of concentration of terms for different reactants. Rate constant is the proportionality factor in the rate law. Rate constant and order of a reaction can be determined from rate law or its integrated rate equation. Molecularity is defined only for an elementary reaction. Its values are limited from 1 to 3 whereas order can be 0, 1, 2, 3 or even a fraction. Molecularity and order of an elementary reaction are same. Temperature dependence of rate constants is described by Arrhenius equation(k = Ae Ea / RT). E corresponds to the activation energy and is given by the a energy difference between activated complex and the reactant molecules, and A(Arrhenius factor or pre - exponential factor) corresponds to the collision frequency. The equation clearly shows that increase of temperature or lowering of E will a lead to an increase in the rate of reaction and presence of a catalyst lowers the activation energy by providing an alternate path for the reaction. According to collision theory, another factor P called steric factor which refers to the orientation of molecules which collide, is important and contributes to effective collisions, thus, modifying the Arrhenius equation to k PZ e Ea / RT.

The two series of the inner transition\nlanthanoids and actinoids with metals; 4f (Ce to Lu) and 5f (Th to Lr) are known as\nrespect to their electronic lanthanoids and actinoids respectively.\nconfigurations, oxidation states\nOriginally the name transition metals was derived\nand chemical behaviour.\nfrom the fact that their chemical properties were\ntransitional between those of s and p-block elements.\nNow according to IUPAC, transition metals are defined\nas metals which have incomplete d subshell either in\nneutral atom or in their ions. Zinc, cadmium and\nmercury of group 12 have full d10 configuration in their\nground state as well as in their common oxidation states\nand hence, are not regarded as transition metals.\nHowever, being the end members of the 3d, 4d and 5d\ntransition series, respectively, their chemistry is studied\nalong with the chemistry of the transition metals.\nThe presence of partly filled d or f orbitals in their\natoms makes transition elements different from that of\nReprint 2025-26\nthe non-transition elements. Hence, transition elements\nand their compounds are studied separately. However,\nthe usual theory of valence as applicable to the non-\ntransition elements can be applied successfully to the\ntransition elements also.\nVarious precious metals such as silver, gold and\nplatinum and industrially important metals like iron,\ncopper and titanium belong to the transition metals series.\nIn this Unit, we shall first deal with the electronic\nconfiguration, occurrence and general characteristics of\ntransition elements with special emphasis on the trends\nin the properties of the first row (3d) transition metals\nalong with the preparation and properties of some\nimportant compounds. This will be followed by\nconsideration of certain general aspects such as electronic\nconfigurations, oxidation states and chemical reactivity\nof the inner transition metals.\nTHE TRANSITION ELEMENTS (d-BLOCK)\n44444.....11111 PPPPPooooosssssiiiiitttttiiiiiooooonnnnn iiiiinnnnn ttttthhhhheeeee\nThe d–block occupies the large middle section of the periodic table\nPPPPPeeeeerrrrriiiiiooooodddddiiiiiccccc TTTTTaaaaabbbbbllllleeeee flanked between s– and p– blocks in the periodic table. The d–orbitals\nof the penultimate energy level of atoms receive electrons giving rise to\nfour rows of the transition metals, i.e., 3d, 4d, 5d and 6d. All these\nseries of transition elements are shown in Table 4.1.\nIn general the electronic configuration of outer orbitals of these elements\n44444.....22222 EEEEEllllleeeeeccccctttttrrrrrooooonnnnniiiiiccccc\nis (n-1)d1–10ns1–2except for Pd where its electronic configuration is 4d105s0.\nCCCCCooooonnnnnfffffiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrraaaaatttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\nThe (n–1) stands for the inner d orbitals which may have one to ten\nooooofffff ttttthhhhheeeee ddddd-----BBBBBllllloooooccccckkkkk electrons and the outermost ns orbital may have one or two electrons.\nHowever, this generalisation has several exceptions because of very\nEEEEEllllleeeeemmmmmeeeeennnnntttttsssss\nlittle energy difference between (n-1)d and ns orbitals. Furthermore,\nhalf and completely filled sets of orbitals are relatively more stable. A\nconsequence of this factor is reflected in the electronic configurations\nof Cr and Cu in the 3d series. For example, consider the case of Cr,\nwhich has 3d5 4s1 configuration instead of 3d44s2; the energy gap\nbetween the two sets (3d and 4s) of orbitals is small enough to prevent\nelectron entering the 3d orbitals. Similarly in case of Cu, the\nconfiguration is 3d104s1 and not 3d94s2. The ground state electronic\nconfigurations of the outer orbitals of transition elements are given in\nTable 4.1.\nTable 4.1: Electronic Configurations of outer orbitals of the Transition Elements\n(ground state)\n1st Series\nSc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zn\nZ 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\n4s 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 2\n3d 1 2 3 5 5 6 7 8 10 10\nChemistry 90\nReprint 2025-26\n2nd Series\nY Zr Nb Mo Tc Ru Rh Pd Ag Cd\nZ 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48\n5s 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 2\n4d 1 2 4 5 6 7 8 10 10 10\n3rd Series\nLa Hf Ta W Re Os Ir Pt Au Hg\nZ 57 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80\n6s 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 2\n5d 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 10\n4th Series\nAc Rf Db Sg Bh Hs Mt Ds Rg Cn\nZ 89 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112\n7s 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2\n6d 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 10\nThe electronic configurations of outer orbitals of Zn, Cd, Hg and Cn\nare represented by the general formula (n-1)d10ns2. The orbitals in\nthese elements are completely filled in the ground state as well as in\ntheir common oxidation states. Therefore, they are not regarded as\ntransition elements.\nThe d orbitals of the transition elements protrude to the periphery of\nan atom more than the other orbitals (i.e., s and p), hence, they are more\ninfluenced by the surroundings as well as affect the atoms or molecules\nsurrounding them. In some respects, ions of a given dn configuration\n(n = 1 – 9) have similar magnetic and electronic properties. With partly\nfilled d orbitals these elements exhibit certain characteristic properties\nsuch as display of a variety of oxidation states, formation of coloured\nions and entering into complex formation with a variety of ligands.\nThe transition metals and their compounds also exhibit catalytic\nproperty and paramagnetic behaviour. All these characteristics have\nbeen discussed in detail later in this Unit.\nThere are greater similarities in the properties of the transition\nelements of a horizontal row in contrast to the non-transition elements.\nHowever, some group similarities also exist. We shall first study the\ngeneral characteristics and their trends in the horizontal rows\n(particularly 3d row) and then consider some group similarities.\nOn what ground can you say that scandium (Z = 21) is a transition EEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 44444.....11111\nelement but zinc (Z = 30) is not?\nOn the basis of incompletely filled 3d orbitals in case of scandium atom SSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\nin its ground state (3d1), it is regarded as a transition element.

The high melting points of these metals\nHf Tc\nare attributed to the involvement of greater\nCr number of electrons from (n-1)d in addition to\nRh\nZr V Pt the ns electrons in the interatomic metallic\nTi Fe Co Pd bonding. In any row the melting points of these\nmetals rise to a maximum at d5 except for\nNi\nanomalous values of Mn and Tc and fall\nMn\nCu regularly as the atomic number increases.\nAu\nAg They have high enthalpies of atomisation which\nare shown in Fig. 4.2.

In general, greater the\nnumber of valence electrons, stronger is the resultant bonding. Since\nthe enthalpy of atomisation is an important factor in determining the\nstandard electrode potential of a metal, metals with very high enthalpy\nof atomisation (i.e., very high boiling point) tend to be noble in their\nreactions (see later for electrode potentials).\nAnother generalisation that may be drawn from Fig. 4.2 is that the\nmetals of the second and third series have greater enthalpies of\natomisation than the corresponding elements of the first series; this is an\nimportant factor in accounting for the occurrence of much more frequent\nmetal – metal bonding in compounds of the heavy transition metals.\nFig. 4.2\nTrends in enthalpies\nof atomisation of\ntransition elements\n4.3.2 Variation in In general, ions of the same charge in a given series show progressive\nAtomic and decrease in radius with increasing atomic number. This is because the\nIonic Sizes new electron enters a d orbital each time the nuclear charge increases\nof by unity. It may be recalled that the shielding effect of a d electron is\nTransition not that effective, hence the net electrostatic attraction between the\nMetals nuclear charge and the outermost electron increases and the ionic\nradius decreases. The same trend is observed in the atomic radii of a\ngiven series. However, the variation within a series is quite small. An\ninteresting point emerges when atomic sizes of one series are compared\nwith those of the corresponding elements in the other series. The curves\nin Fig. 4.3 show an increase from the first (3d) to the second (4d) series\nof the elements but the radii of the third (5d) series are virtually the\nsame as those of the corresponding members of the second series. This\nphenomenon is associated with the intervention of the 4f orbitals which\nmust be filled before the 5d series of elements begin. The filling of 4f\nbefore 5d orbital results in a regular decrease in atomic radii called\nLanthanoid contraction which essentially compensates for the expected\n93 The d- and f- Block Elements\n1–lom\nJk/VHD\na\nReprint 2025-26\nincrease in atomic size with increasing atomic number. The net result\nof the lanthanoid contraction is that the second and the third d series\nexhibit similar radii (e.g., Zr 160 pm, Hf 159 pm) and have very similar\nphysical and chemical properties much more than that expected on\nthe basis of usual family relationship.\n19 The factor responsible for the lanthanoid\ncontraction is somewhat similar to that observed\n18\nin an ordinary transition series and is attributed\nto similar cause, i.e., the imperfect shielding of\n16 one electron by another in the same set of orbitals.\nHowever, the shielding of one 4f electron by\n15\nanother is less than that of one d electron by\nanother, and as the nuclear charge increases\nalong the series, there is fairly regular decrease\n13\nin the size of the entire 4f n orbitals.\n12\nSc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zn The decrease in metallic radius coupled with\nY Zr Nb Mo Tc Ru Rh Pd Ag Cd increase in atomic mass results in a general\nincrease in the density of these elements.

Why?\n4.3.3 Ionisation There is an increase in ionisation enthalpy along each series of the\nEnthalpies transition elements from left to right due to an increase in nuclear\ncharge which accompanies the filling of the inner d orbitals. Table\n4.2 gives the values of the first three ionisation enthalpies of the first\nseries of transition elements. These values show that the successive\nenthalpies of these elements do not increase as steeply as in the case\nof non-transition elements. The variation in ionisation enthalpy along\na series of transition elements is much less in comparison to the variation\nalong a period of non-transition elements. The first ionisation enthalpy,\nin general, increases, but the magnitude of the increase in the second\nand third ionisation enthalpies for the successive elements, is much\nhigher along a series.\nThe irregular trend in the first ionisation enthalpy of the metals of\n3d series, though of little chemical significance, can be accounted for\nby considering that the removal of one electron alters the relative energies\nof 4s and 3d orbitals. You have learnt that when d-block elements form\nions, ns electrons are lost before (n – 1) d electrons. As we move along\nthe period in 3d series, we see that nuclear charge increases from\nscandium to zinc but electrons are added to the orbital of inner subshell,\ni.e., 3d orbitals. These 3d electrons shield the 4s electrons from the\nincreasing nuclear charge somewhat more effectively than the outer\nshell electrons can shield one another. Therefore, the atomic radii\ndecrease less rapidly. Thus, ionization energies increase only slightly\nalong the 3d series. The doubly or more highly charged ions have dn\nconfigurations with no 4s electrons. A general trend of increasing values\nof second ionisation enthalpy is expected as the effective nuclear charge\nincreases because one d electron does not shield another electron from\nthe influence of nuclear charge because d-orbitals differ in direction.\nHowever, the trend of steady increase in second and third ionisation\nenthalpy breaks for the formation of Mn2+ and Fe3+ respectively. In both\nthe cases, ions have d5 configuration. Similar breaks occur at\ncorresponding elements in the later transition series.\nThe interpretation of variation in ionisation enthalpy for an electronic\nconfiguration dn is as follows:\nThe three terms responsible for the value of ionisation enthalpy are\nattraction of each electron towards nucleus, repulsion between the\n95 The d- and f- Block Elements\nReprint 2025-26\nelectrons and the exchange energy. Exchange energy is responsible for\nthe stabilisation of energy state. Exchange energy is approximately\nproportional to the total number of possible pairs of parallel spins in\nthe degenerate orbitals. When several electrons occupy a set of\ndegenerate orbitals, the lowest energy state corresponds to the maximum\npossible extent of single occupation of orbital and parallel spins (Hunds\nrule). The loss of exchange energy increases the stability. As the stability\nincreases, the ionisation becomes more difficult. There is no loss of\nexchange energy at d6 configuration. Mn+ has 3d54s1 configuration and\nconfiguration of Cr+ is d5, therefore, ionisation enthalpy of Mn+ is lower\nthan Cr+. In the same way, Fe2+ has d6 configuration and Mn2+ has 3d5\nconfiguration. Hence, ionisation enthalpy of Fe2+ is lower than the Mn2+.\nIn other words, we can say that the third ionisation enthalpy of Fe is\nlower than that of Mn.\nThe lowest common oxidation state of these metals is +2. To\nform the M2+ ions from the gaseous atoms, the sum of the first and\nsecond ionisation enthalpy is required in addition to the enthalpy of\natomisation. The dominant term is the second ionisation enthalpy\nwhich shows unusually high values for Cr and Cu where M+ ions\nhave the d5 and d10 configurations respectively. The value for Zn is\ncorrespondingly low as the ionisation causes the removal of one 4s\nelectron which results in the formation of stable d10 configuration.\nThe trend in the third ionisation enthalpies is not complicated by\nthe 4s orbital factor and shows the greater difficulty of removing an\nelectron from the d5 (Mn2+) and d10 (Zn2+) ions. In general, the third\nionisation enthalpies are quite high. Also the high values for third\nionisation enthalpies of copper, nickel and zinc indicate why it is\ndifficult to obtain oxidation state greater than two for these elements.\nAlthough ionisation enthalpies give some guidance concerning the\nrelative stabilities of oxidation states, this problem is very complex and\nnot amenable to ready generalisation.\n4.3.4 Oxidation One of the notable features of a transition elements is the great variety\nStates of oxidation states these may show in their compounds. Table 4.3 lists\nthe common oxidation states of the first row transition elements.\nTable 4.3: Oxidation States of the first row Transition Metal\n(the most common ones are in bold types)\nSc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zn\n+2 +2 +2 +2 +2 +2 +2 +1 +2\n+3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +2\n+4 +4 +4 +4 +4 +4 +4\n+5 +5 +5\n+6 +6 +6\n+7\nChemistry 96\nReprint 2025-26\nThe elements which give the greatest number of oxidation states\noccur in or near the middle of the series. Manganese, for example,\nexhibits all the oxidation states from +2 to +7. The lesser number of\noxidation states at the extreme ends stems from either too few electrons\nto lose or share (Sc, Ti) or too many d electrons (hence fewer orbitals\navailable in which to share electrons with others) for higher valence\n(Cu, Zn). Thus, early in the series scandium(II) is virtually unknown\nand titanium (IV) is more stable than Ti(III) or Ti(II). At the other end,\nthe only oxidation state of zinc is +2 (no d electrons are involved). The\nmaximum oxidation states of reasonable stability correspond in value\nto the sum of the s and d electrons upto manganese (TiIVO , VVO +,\n2 2\nCrV1O 2–, MnVIIO –) followed by a rather abrupt decrease in stability of\n4 4\nhigher oxidation states, so that the typical species to follow are FeII,III,\nCoII,III, NiII, CuI,II, ZnII.\nThe variability of oxidation states, a characteristic of transition\nelements, arises out of incomplete filling of d orbitals in such a way\nthat their oxidation states differ from each other by unity, e.g., VII, VIII,\nVIV, VV. This is in contrast with the variability of oxidation states of non\ntransition elements where oxidation states normally differ by a unit\nof two.\nAn interesting feature in the variability of oxidation states of the d–\nblock elements is noticed among the groups (groups 4 through 10).\nAlthough in the p–block the lower oxidation states are favoured by the\nheavier members (due to inert pair effect), the opposite is true in the\ngroups of d-block. For example, in group 6, Mo(VI) and W(VI) are\nfound to be more stable than Cr(VI). Thus Cr(VI) in the form of dichromate\nin acidic medium is a strong oxidising agent, whereas MoO and WO\n3 3\nare not.\nLow oxidation states are found when a complex compound has\nligands capable of p-acceptor character in addition to the s-bonding.\nFor example, in Ni(CO) and Fe(CO) , the oxidation state of nickel and\n4 5\niron is zero.\nName a transition element which does not exhibit variable EEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 44444.....33333\noxidation states.\nScandium (Z = 21) does not exhibit variable oxidation states.\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\n4.3 Which of the 3d series of the transition metals exhibits the\nlargest number of oxidation states and why?\n97 The d- and f- Block Elements\nReprint 2025-26\n4.3.5 Trends in the Table 4.4 contains the thermochemical parameters related to the\nM2+/M transformation of the solid metal atoms to M2+ ions in solution and their\nV\nStandard standard electrode potentials.

The general trend towards less negative E values across the\nFig. 4.4:Observed and calculated values for the standard\nelectrode potentials\n(M2+ fi M°) of the elements Ti to Zn\nseries is related to the general increase in the sum of the first and second\nV\nionisation enthalpies.

The low value for Sc reflects the stability of Sc3+ which has a\nStandard noble gas configuration. The highest value for Zn is due to the removal\nElectrode of an electron from the stable d10 configuration of Zn2+. The\nPotentials comparatively high value for Mn shows that Mn2+(d5) is particularly\nstable, whereas comparatively low value for Fe shows the extra stability\nof Fe3+ (d5). The comparatively low value for V is related to the stability\nof V2+ (half-filled t level, Unit 5).\n2g\n4.3.7 Trends in Table 4.5 shows the stable halides of the 3d series of transition metals.\nStability of The highest oxidation numbers are achieved in TiX (tetrahalides), VF\n4 5\nHigher and CrF .

The highest oxidation number in the oxides\n(Table 4.6) coincides with the group number and is attained in Sc O\n2 3\nto Mn O . Beyond Group 7, no higher oxides of Fe above Fe O , are\n2 7 2 3\nknown, although ferrates (VI)(FeO )2–, are formed in alkaline media but\n4\nthey readily decompose to Fe O and O .

Many of\nReactivity them are sufficiently electropositive to dissolve in mineral acids, although\nand Eo a few are ‘noble’—that is, they are unaffected by single acids.\nValues The metals of the first series with the exception of copper are relatively\nmore reactive and are oxidised by 1M H+, though the actual rate at\nwhich these metals react with oxidising agents like hydrogen ion (H+) is\nsometimes slow. For example, titanium and vanadium, in practice, are\npassive to dilute non oxidising acids at room temperature. The Eo values\nfor M2+/M (Table 4.2) indicate a decreasing tendency to form divalent\ncations across the series. This general trend towards less negative Eo\nvalues is related to the increase in the sum of the first and second\nionisation enthalpies. It is interesting to note that the Eo values for Mn,\nNi and Zn are more negative than expected from the general trend.\nWhereas the stabilities of half-filled d subshell (d5) in Mn2+ and completely\nfilled d subshell (d10) in zinc are related to their E e values; for nickel, Eo\nvalue is related to the highest negative enthalpy of hydration.\nAn examination of the Eo values for the redox couple M3+/M2+ (Table\n4.2) shows that Mn3+ and Co3+ ions are the strongest oxidising agents\nin aqueous solutions.

Substances which are\n101 The d- and f- Block Elements\nReprint 2025-26\nattracted very strongly are said to be ferromagnetic. In fact,\nferromagnetism is an extreme form of paramagnetism. Many of the\ntransition metal ions are paramagnetic.\nParamagnetism arises from the presence of unpaired electrons, each\nsuch electron having a magnetic moment associated with its spin angular\nmomentum and orbital angular momentum. For the compounds of the\nfirst series of transition metals, the contribution of the orbital angular\nmomentum is effectively quenched and hence is of no significance. For\nthese, the magnetic moment is determined by the number of unpaired\nelectrons and is calculated by using the ‘spin-only’ formula, i.e.,\n  nn2\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons and µ is the magnetic\nmoment in units of Bohr magneton (BM). A single unpaired electron\nhas a magnetic moment of 1.73 Bohr magnetons (BM).\nThe magnetic moment increases with the increasing number of\nunpaired electrons. Thus, the observed magnetic moment gives a useful\nindication about the number of unpaired electrons present in the atom,\nmolecule or ion. The magnetic moments calculated from the ‘spin-only’\nformula and those derived experimentally for some ions of the first row\ntransition elements are given in Table 4.7.

This is due to the comparatively\nsmaller sizes of the metal ions, their high ionic charges and the\navailability of d orbitals for bond formation.\n4.3.12 Catalytic The transition metals and their compounds are known for their catalytic\nProperties activity. This activity is ascribed to their ability to adopt multiple\noxidation states and to form complexes. Vanadium(V) oxide (in Contact\nProcess), finely divided iron (in Haber’s Process), and nickel (in Catalytic\nHydrogenation) are some of the examples. Catalysts at a solid surface\ninvolve the formation of bonds between reactant molecules and atoms\nof the surface of the catalyst (first row transition metals utilise 3d and\n4s electrons for bonding). This has the effect of increasing the\nconcentration of the reactants at the catalyst surface and also weakening\nof the bonds in the reacting molecules (the activation energy is lowering).\nAlso because the transition metal ions can change their oxidation states,\nthey become more effective as catalysts. For example, iron(III) catalyses\nthe reaction between iodide and persulphate ions.\n2 I– + S O 2– fi I + 2 SO 2–\n2 8 2 4\nAn explanation of this catalytic action can be given as:\n2 Fe3+ + 2 I– fi 2 Fe2+ + I\n2\n2 Fe2+ + S O 2– fi 2 Fe3+ + 2SO 2–\n2 8 4\n4.3.13 Formation Interstitial compounds are those which are formed when small atoms\nof like H, C or N are trapped inside the crystal lattices of metals. They are\nInterstitial usually non stoichiometric and are neither typically ionic nor covalent,\nCompounds for example, TiC, Mn N, Fe H, VH . and TiH , etc. The formulas\n4 3 0 56 1.7\nquoted do not, of course, correspond to any normal oxidation state of\nthe metal. Because of the nature of their composition, these compounds\nare referred to as interstitial compounds. The principal physical and\nchemical characteristics of these compounds are as follows:\n(i) They have high melting points, higher than those of pure metals.\n(ii) They are very hard, some borides approach diamond in hardness.\n(iii) They retain metallic conductivity.\n(iv) They are chemically inert.\n4.3.14 Alloy An alloy is a blend of metals prepared by mixing the components.\nFormation Alloys may be homogeneous solid solutions in which the atoms of one\nmetal are distributed randomly among the atoms of the other. Such\nalloys are formed by atoms with metallic radii that are within about 15\npercent of each other. Because of similar radii and other characteristics\nof transition metals, alloys are readily formed by these metals. The\nalloys so formed are hard and have often high melting points. The best\nknown are ferrous alloys: chromium, vanadium, tungsten, molybdenum\nand manganese are used for the production of a variety of steels and\nstainless steel. Alloys of transition metals with non transition metals\nsuch as brass (copper-zinc) and bronze (copper-tin), are also of\nconsiderable industrial importance.\nChemistry 104\nReprint 2025-26\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 44444.....99999 What is meant by ‘disproportionation’ of an oxidation state?

Beyond group 7, no higher oxides of iron above Fe O are\n2 7 2 3\nknown. Besides the oxides, the oxocations stabilise VV as VO +, VIV as\n2\nVO2+ and TiIV as TiO2+.\nAs the oxidation number of a metal increases, ionic character\ndecreases. In the case of Mn, Mn O is a covalent green oil. Even CrO\n2 7 3\nand V O have low melting points. In these higher oxides, the acidic\n2 5\ncharacter is predominant.\nThus, Mn O gives HMnO and CrO gives H CrO and H Cr O .\n2 7 4 3 2 4 2 2 7\nV O is, however, amphoteric though mainly acidic and it gives VO 3– as\n2 5 4\nwell as VO + salts. In vanadium there is gradual change from the basic\n2\nV O to less basic V O and to amphoteric V O . V O dissolves in acids\n2 3 2 4 2 5 2 4\nto give VO2+ salts. Similarly, V O reacts with alkalies as well as acids\n2 5\nto giveVO3 andVO respectively. The well characterised CrO is basic\n4 4\nbut Cr O is amphoteric.\n2 3\nPotassium dichromate K Cr O\n2 2 7\nPotassium dichromate is a very important chemical used in leather\nindustry and as an oxidant for preparation of many azo compounds.\nDichromates are generally prepared from chromate, which in turn are\nobtained by the fusion of chromite ore (FeCr O ) with sodium or\n2 4\npotassium carbonate in free access of air. The reaction with sodium\ncarbonate occurs as follows:\n4 FeCr O + 8 Na CO + 7 O fi 8 Na CrO + 2 Fe O + 8 CO\n2 4 2 3 2 2 4 2 3 2\nThe yellow solution of sodium chromate is filtered and acidified\nwith sulphuric acid to give a solution from which orange sodium\ndichromate, Na Cr O .2H O can be crystallised.\n2 2 7 2\n2Na CrO + 2 H+ fi Na Cr O + 2 Na+ + H O\n2 4 2 2 7 2\n105 The d- and f- Block Elements\nReprint 2025-26\nSodium dichromate is more soluble than potassium dichromate.\nThe latter is therefore, prepared by treating the solution of sodium\ndichromate with potassium chloride.\nNa Cr O + 2 KCl fi K Cr O + 2 NaCl\n2 2 7 2 2 7\nOrange crystals of potassium dichromate crystallise out. The\nchromates and dichromates are interconvertible in aqueous solution\ndepending upon pH of the solution. The oxidation state of chromium\nin chromate and dichromate is the same.\n2 CrO 2– + 2H+ fi Cr O 2– + H O\n4 2 7 2\nCr O 2– + 2 OH- fi 2 CrO 2– + H O\n2 7 4 2\nThe structures of\nchromate ion, CrO 2– and\n4\nthe dichromate ion, Cr O 2–\n2 7\nare shown below. The\nchromate ion is tetrahedral\nwhereas the dichromate ion\nconsists of two tetrahedra\nsharing one corner with\nCr–O–Cr bond angle of 126°.\nSodium and potassium dichromates are strong oxidising agents;\nthe sodium salt has a greater solubility in water and is extensively\nused as an oxidising agent in organic chemistry. Potassium dichromate\nis used as a primary standard in volumetric analysis. In acidic solution,\nits oxidising action can be represented as follows:\nCr O 2– + 14H+ + 6e– fi 2Cr3+ + 7H O (Eo = 1.33V)\n2 7 2\nThus, acidified potassium dichromate will oxidise iodides to iodine,\nsulphides to sulphur, tin(II) to tin(IV) and iron(II) salts to iron(III). The\nhalf-reactions are noted below:\n6 I– fi 3I + 6 e–; 3 Sn2+ fi 3Sn4+ + 6 e–\n2\n3 H S fi 6H+ + 3S + 6e–; 6 Fe2+ fi 6Fe3+ + 6 e–\n2\nThe full ionic equation may be obtained by adding the half-reaction for\npotassium dichromate to the half-reaction for the reducing agent, for e.g.,\nCr O 2– + 14 H+ + 6 Fe2+ fi 2 Cr3+ + 6 Fe3+ + 7 H O\n2 7 2\nPotassium permanganate KMnO\n4\nPotassium permanganate is prepared by fusion of MnO with an alkali\n2\nmetal hydroxide and an oxidising agent like KNO . This produces the\n3\ndark green K MnO which disproportionates in a neutral or acidic\n2 4\nsolution to give permanganate.\n2MnO + 4KOH + O fi 2K MnO + 2H O\n2 2 2 4 2\n3MnO 2– + 4H+ fi 2MnO – + MnO + 2H O\n4 4 2 2\nCommercially it is prepared by the alkaline oxidative fusion of MnO\n2\nfollowed by the electrolytic oxidation of manganate (Vl).\nFusedwithKOH,oxidised Electrolyticoxidationin\nMnO (cid:190)(cid:190)(cid:190)(cid:190)(cid:190)(cid:190)(cid:190)(cid:190)fi(cid:190)(cid:190) withairorKNO 3 MnO2- ; MnO2 alkalinesolutionMnO\n2 4 4 4\nmanganate ion manganate permanganate ion\nChemistry 106\nReprint 2025-26\nIn the laboratory, a manganese (II) ion salt is oxidised by\nperoxodisulphate to permanganate.\n2Mn2+ + 5S O 2– + 8H O fi 2MnO – + 10SO 2– + 16H+\n2 8 2 4 4\nPotassium permanganate forms dark purple (almost black) crystals which\nare isostructural with those of KClO . The salt is not very soluble in water\n4\n(6.4 g/100 g of water at 293 K), but when heated it decomposes at 513 K.\n2KMnO fi K MnO + MnO + O\n4 2 4 2 2\nIt has two physical properties of considerable interest: its intense colour\nand its diamagnetism along with temperature-dependent weak\nparamagnetism. These can be explained by the use of molecular orbital\ntheory which is beyond the present scope.\nThe manganate and permanganate ions are tetrahedral; the p-\nbonding takes place by overlap of p orbitals of oxygen with d orbitals\nof manganese. The green manganate is paramagnetic because of one\nunpaired electron but the permanganate is diamagnetic due to the\nabsence of unpaired electron.\nAcidified permanganate solution oxidises oxalates to carbon dioxide,\niron(II) to iron(III), nitrites to nitrates and iodides to free iodine.\nThe half-reactions of reductants are:\nCOO–\n5 10CO + 10e–\n2\nCOO–\n5 Fe2+ fi 5 Fe3+ + 5e–\n5NO – + 5H O fi 5NO – + 10H+ + l0e–\n2 2 3\n10I– fi 5I + 10e–\n2\nThe full reaction can be written by adding the half-reaction for\nKMnO to the half-reaction of the reducing agent, balancing wherever\n4\nnecessary.\nIf we represent the reduction of permanganate to manganate,\nmanganese dioxide and manganese(II) salt by half-reactions,\nMnO – + e– fi MnO 2– (Eo = + 0.56 V)\n4 4\nMnO – + 4H+ + 3e– fi MnO + 2H O (Eo = + 1.69 V)\n4 2 2\nMnO – + 8H+ + 5e– fi Mn2+ + 4H O (Eo = + 1.52 V)\n4 2\nWe can very well see that the hydrogen ion concentration of the\nsolution plays an important part in influencing the reaction. Although\nmany reactions can be understood by consideration of redox potential,\nkinetics of the reaction is also an important factor. Permanganate at\n[H+] = 1 should oxidise water but in practice the reaction is extremely slow\nunless either manganese(ll) ions are present or the temperature is raised.\nA few important oxidising reactions of KMnO are given below:\n4\n1.

Its uses for the\nbleaching of wool, cotton, silk and other textile fibres and for the decolourisation\nof oils are also dependent on its strong oxidising power.\nTHE INNER TRANSITION ELEMENTS ( f-BLOCK)\nThe f-block consists of the two series, lanthanoids (the fourteen elements\nfollowing lanthanum) and actinoids (the fourteen elements following\nactinium). Because lanthanum closely resembles the lanthanoids, it is\nusually included in any discussion of the lanthanoids for which the\ngeneral symbol Ln is often used. Similarly, a discussion of the actinoids\nincludes actinium besides the fourteen elements constituting the series.\nThe lanthanoids resemble one another more closely than do the members\nof ordinary transition elements in any series. They have only one stable\noxidation state and their chemistry provides an excellent opportunity to\nexamine the effect of small changes in size and nuclear charge along a\nseries of otherwise similar elements. The chemistry of the actinoids is, on\nthe other hand, much more complicated. The complication arises partly\nowing to the occurrence of a wide range of oxidation states in these\nelements and partly because their radioactivity creates special problems\nin their study; the two series will be considered separately here.\n44444.....55555 TTTTThhhhheeeee\nThe names, symbols, electronic configurations of atomic and some\nLLLLLaaaaannnnnttttthhhhhaaaaannnnnoooooiiiiidddddsssss ionic states and atomic and ionic radii of lanthanum and lanthanoids\n(for which the general symbol Ln is used) are given in Table 4.9.\nChemistry 108\nReprint 2025-26\nSm2\n110\nEu2+\nLa3+\nCe3+\nPr3+\n100 Nd3+\nPm3+\nSm3+\nEu3+\nGd3+ Tm2+\nCe4+ Tb3+\nYb2+\nDy3+\n90\nPr4+\nHo3+\nEr3+\nTm3+\nYb3+\nLu3+\nTb4+\n57 59 61 63 65 67 69 71\n109 The d- and f- Block Elements\nmp/iidar\ncinoI\n4.5.1 Electronic It may be noted that atoms of these elements have electronic\nConfigurations configuration with 6s2 common but with variable occupancy of 4f level\n(Table 4.9). However, the electronic configurations of all the tripositive\nions (the most stable oxidation state of all the lanthanoids) are of the\nform 4f n (n = 1 to 14 with increasing atomic number).\n4.5.2 Atomic and The overall decrease in atomic and ionic radii from lanthanum to\nIonic Sizes lutetium (the lanthanoid contraction) is a unique feature in the\nchemistry of the lanthanoids. It has far reaching\nconsequences in the chemistry of the third\n+\ntransition series of the elements. The decrease\nin atomic radii (derived from the structures of\nmetals) is not quite regular as it is regular in\nM3+ ions (Fig. 4.6). This contraction is, of\ncourse, similar to that observed in an ordinary\ntransition series and is attributed to the same\ncause, the imperfect shielding of one electron\nby another in the same sub-shell. However, the\nshielding of one 4 f electron by another is less\nthan one d electron by another with the increase\nin nuclear charge along the series. There is\nfairly regular decrease in the sizes with\nincreasing atomic number.\nThe cumulative effect of the contraction of\nthe lanthanoid series, known as lanthanoid\ncontraction, causes the radii of the members\nof the third transition series to be very similar\nto those of the corresponding members of the\nsecond series. The almost identical radii of Zr\n(160 pm) and Hf (159 pm), a consequence of\nthe lanthanoid contraction, account for their\nAtomic number\noccurrence together in nature and for the\nFig. 4.6: Trends in ionic radii of lanthanoids difficulty faced in their separation.\n4.5.3 Oxidation In the lanthanoids, La(II) and Ln(III) compounds are predominant\nStates species. However, occasionally +2 and +4 ions in solution or in solid\ncompounds are also obtained. This irregularity (as in ionisation\nenthalpies) arises mainly from the extra stability of empty, half-filled\nor filled f subshell. Thus, the formation of CeIV is favoured by its\nnoble gas configuration, but it is a strong oxidant reverting to the\ncommon +3 state. The Eo value for Ce4+/ Ce3+ is + 1.74 V which\nsuggests that it can oxidise water. However, the reaction rate is very\nslow and hence Ce(IV) is a good analytical reagent. Pr, Nd, Tb and Dy\nalso exhibit +4 state but only in oxides, MO . Eu2+ is formed by losing\n2\nthe two s electrons and its f 7 configuration accounts for the formation\nof this ion. However, Eu2+ is a strong reducing agent changing to the\ncommon +3 state. Similarly Yb2+ which has f 14 configuration is a\nreductant. TbIV has half-filled f-orbitals and is an oxidant. The\nbehaviour of samarium is very much like europium, exhibiting both\n+2 and +3 oxidation states.\nReprint 2025-26\nTable 4.9: Electronic Configurations and Radii of Lanthanum and Lanthanoids\nElectronic configurations* Radii/pm\nAtomic Name Symbol Ln Ln2+ Ln3+ Ln4+ Ln Ln3+\nNumber\n57 Lanthanum La 5d16s2 5d1 4f 0 187 106\n58 Cerium Ce 4f15d16s2 4f 2 4f 1 4f 0 183 103\n59 Praseodymium Pr 4f 36s2 4f 3 4f 2 4f 1 182 101\n60 Neodymium Nd 4f 46s2 4f 4 4f 3 4f 2 181 99\n61 Promethium Pm 4f 56s2 4f 5 4f 4 181 98\n62 Samarium Sm 4f 66s2 4f 6 4f 5 180 96\n63 Europium Eu 4f 76s2 4f 7 4f 6 199 95\n64 Gadolinium Gd 4f 75d16s2 4f 75d1 4f 7 180 94\n65 Terbium Tb 4f 96s2 4f 9 4f 8 4f 7 178 92\n66 Dysprosium Dy 4f 106s2 4f 10 4f 9 4f 8 177 91\n67 Holmium Ho 4f 116s2 4f 11 4f 10 176 89\n68 Erbium Er 4f 126s2 4f 12 4f 11 175 88\n69 Thulium Tm 4f 136s2 4f 13 4f 12 174 87\n70 Ytterbium Yb 4f 146s2 4f 14 4f 13 173 86\n71 Lutetium Lu 4f 145d16s2 4f 145d1 4f 14 – – –\n* Only electrons outside [Xe] core are indicated\n4.5.4 General All the lanthanoids are silvery white soft metals and tarnish rapidly in air.\nCharacteristics The hardness increases with increasing atomic number, samarium being\nsteel hard. Their melting points range between 1000 to 1200 K but\nsamarium melts at 1623 K. They have typical metallic structure and are\ngood conductors of heat and electricity. Density and other properties\nchange smoothly except for Eu and Yb and occasionally for Sm and Tm.\nMany trivalent lanthanoid ions are coloured both in the solid state\nand in aqueous solutions. Colour of these ions may be attributed to\nthe presence of f electrons. Neither La3+ nor Lu3+ ion shows any colour\nbut the rest do so. However, absorption bands are narrow, probably\nbecause of the excitation within f level. The lanthanoid ions other\nthan the f 0 type (La3+ and Ce4+) and the f 14 type (Yb2+ and Lu3+) are\nall paramagnetic.\nThe first ionisation enthalpies of the lanthanoids are around\n600 kJ mol–1, the second about 1200 kJ mol–1 comparable with those\nof calcium. A detailed discussion of the variation of the third ionisation\nenthalpies indicates that the exchange enthalpy considerations (as in\n3d orbitals of the first transition series), appear to impart a certain\ndegree of stability to empty, half-filled and completely filled orbitals\nf level. This is indicated from the abnormally low value of the third\nionisation enthalpy of lanthanum, gadolinium and lutetium.\nIn their chemical behaviour, in general, the earlier members of the series\nare quite reactive similar to calcium but, with increasing atomic number,\nthey behave more like aluminium.

The latter members could be\nprepared only in nanogram quantities. These facts render their study\nmore difficult.\n4.6.1 Electronic All the actinoids are believed to have the electronic configuration of 7s2\nConfigurations and variable occupancy of the 5f and 6d subshells. The fourteen electrons\nare formally added to 5f, though not in thorium (Z = 90) but from Pa\nonwards the 5f orbitals are complete at element 103. The irregularities in\nthe electronic configurations of the actinoids, like those in the lanthanoids\nare related to the stabilities of the f 0, f 7 and f 14 occupancies of the 5f\norbitals. Thus, the configurations of Am and Cm are [Rn] 5f 77s2 and\n[Rn] 5f 76d17s2. Although the 5f orbitals resemble the 4f orbitals in their\nangular part of the wave-function, they are not as buried as 4f orbitals\nand hence 5f electrons can participate in bonding to a far greater extent.\n4.6.2 Ionic Sizes The general trend in lanthanoids is observable in the actinoids as well.\nThere is a gradual decrease in the size of atoms or M3+ ions across the\nseries. This may be referred to as the actinoid contraction (like lanthanoid\ncontraction). The contraction is, however, greater from element to element\nin this series resulting from poor shielding by 5f electrons.\n4.6.3 Oxidation There is a greater range of oxidation states, which is in part attributed to\nStates the fact that the 5f, 6d and 7s levels are of comparable energies. The\nknown oxidation states of actinoids are listed in Table 4.11.\nThe actinoids show in general +3 oxidation state. The elements, in the\nfirst half of the series frequently exhibit higher oxidation states. For example,\nthe maximum oxidation state increases from +4 in Th to +5, +6 and +7\nrespectively in Pa, U and Np but decreases in succeeding elements (Table\n4.11). The actinoids resemble the lanthanoids in having more compounds\nin +3 state than in the +4 state. However, +3 and +4 ions tend to hydrolyse.\nBecause the distribution of oxidation states among the actinoids is so\nuneven and so different for the former and later elements, it is unsatisfactory\nto review their chemistry in terms of oxidation states.\nTable 4.11: Oxidation States of Actinium and Actinoids\nAc Th Pa U Np Pu Am Cm Bk Cf Es Fm Md No Lr\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n5 5 5 5 5\n6 6 6 6\n7 7\n4.6.4 General The actinoid metals are all silvery in appearance but display\nCharacteristics a variety of structures. The structural variability is obtained\nand Comparison due to irregularities in metallic radii which are far greater\nwith Lanthanoids than in lanthanoids.\nChemistry 112\nReprint 2025-26\nThe actinoids are highly reactive metals, especially when finely divided.\nThe action of boiling water on them, for example, gives a mixture of oxide\nand hydride and combination with most non metals takes place at\nmoderate temperatures. Hydrochloric acid attacks all metals but most are\nslightly affected by nitric acid owing to the formation of protective oxide\nlayers; alkalies have no action.\nThe magnetic properties of the actinoids are more complex than those\nof the lanthanoids. Although the variation in the magnetic susceptibility\nof the actinoids with the number of unpaired 5 f electrons is roughly\nparallel to the corresponding results for the lanthanoids, the latter have\nhigher values.\nIt is evident from the behaviour of the actinoids that the ionisation\nenthalpies of the early actinoids, though not accurately known, but are\nlower than for the early lanthanoids. This is quite reasonable since it is to\nbe expected that when 5f orbitals are beginning to be occupied, they will\npenetrate less into the inner core of electrons. The 5f electrons, will therefore,\nbe more effectively shielded from the nuclear charge than the 4f electrons\nof the corresponding lanthanoids. Because the outer electrons are less\nfirmly held, they are available for bonding in the actinoids.\nA comparison of the actinoids with the lanthanoids, with respect to\ndifferent characteristics as discussed above, reveals that behaviour similar\nto that of the lanthanoids is not evident until the second half of the\nactinoid series. However, even the early actinoids resemble the lanthanoids\nin showing close similarities with each other and in gradual variation in\nproperties which do not entail change in oxidation state. The lanthanoid\nand actinoid contractions, have extended effects on the sizes, and\ntherefore, the properties of the elements succeeding them in their\nrespective periods. The lanthanoid contraction is more important because\nthe chemistry of elements succeeding the actinoids are much less known\nat the present time.\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 44444.....1111100000\nName a member of the lanthanoid series which is well known\nto exhibit +4 oxidation state.\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn Cerium (Z = 58)\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\n4.10 Actinoid contraction is greater from element to element than\nlanthanoid contraction.

The ‘silver’ UK coins are a Cu/Ni alloy. Many of\nthe metals and/or their compounds are essential catalysts in the chemical\nindustry. V O catalyses the oxidation of SO in the manufacture of\n2 5 2\nsulphuric acid. TiCl with A1(CH ) forms the basis of the Ziegler catalysts\n4 33\nused to manufacture polyethylene (polythene). Iron catalysts are used in\nthe Haber process for the production of ammonia from N /H mixtures.\n2 2\nNickel catalysts enable the hydrogenation of fats to proceed. In the Wacker\nprocess the oxidation of ethyne to ethanal is catalysed by PdCl . Nickel\n2\ncomplexes are useful in the polymerisation of alkynes and other organic\ncompounds such as benzene. The photographic industry relies on the\nspecial light-sensitive properties of AgBr.\nSSSSSuuuuummmmmmmmmmaaaaarrrrryyyyy\nThe d-block consisting of Groups 3-12 occupies the large middle section of the periodic\ntable. In these elements the inner d orbitals are progressively filled. The f-block is placed\noutside at the bottom of the periodic table and in the elements of this block, 4f and\n5f orbitals are progressively filled.\nCorresponding to the filling of 3d, 4d and 5d orbitals, three series of transition\nelements are well recognised. All the transition elements exhibit typical metallic properties\nsuch as –high tensile strength, ductility, malleability, thermal and electrical conductivity\nand metallic character. Their melting and boiling points are high which are attributed\nto the involvement of (n–1)d electrons resulting into strong interatomic bonding. In\nmany of these properties, the maxima occur at about the middle of each series which\nindicates that one unpaired electron per d orbital is particularly a favourable configuration\nfor strong interatomic interaction.\nSuccessive ionisation enthalpies do not increase as steeply as in the main group\nelements with increasing atomic number. Hence, the loss of variable number of electrons\nfrom (n–1)d orbitals is not energetically unfavourable. The involvement of (n–1)d electrons\nin the behaviour of transition elements impart certain distinct characteristics to these\nelements. Thus, in addition to variable oxidation states, they exhibit paramagnetic\nbehaviour, catalytic properties and tendency for the formation of coloured ions, interstitial\ncompounds and complexes.\nThe transition elements vary widely in their chemical behaviour. Many of them are\nsufficiently electropositive to dissolve in mineral acids, although a few are ‘noble’. Of the\nfirst series, with the exception of copper, all the metals are relatively reactive.\nThe transition metals react with a number of non-metals like oxygen, nitrogen,\nsulphur and halogens to form binary compounds. The first series transition metal oxides\nare generally formed from the reaction of metals with oxygen at high temperatures. These\noxides dissolve in acids and bases to form oxometallic salts. Potassium dichromate and\npotassium permanganate are common examples. Potassium dichromate is prepared from\nthe chromite ore by fusion with alkali in presence of air and acidifying the extract.\nPyrolusite ore (MnO ) is used for the preparation of potassium permanganate. Both the\n2\ndichromate and the permanganate ions are strong oxidising agents.\nThe two series of inner transition elements, lanthanoids and actinoids constitute\nthe f-block of the periodic table. With the successive filling of the inner orbitals, 4f, there\nis a gradual decrease in the atomic and ionic sizes of these metals along the series\n(lanthanoid contraction). This has far reaching consequences in the chemistry of the\nelements succeeding them. Lanthanum and all the lanthanoids are rather soft white\nmetals. They react easily with water to give solutions giving +3 ions. The principal\noxidation state is +3, although +4 and +2 oxidation states are also exhibited by some\nChemistry 114\nReprint 2025-26\noccasionally. The chemistry of the actinoids is more complex in view of their ability to\nexist in different oxidation states. Furthermore, many of the actinoid elements are radioactive\nwhich make the study of these elements rather difficult.\nThere are many useful applications of the d- and f-block elements and their\ncompounds, notable among them being in varieties of steels, catalysts, complexes,\norganic syntheses, etc.\nExercises\n4.1 Write down the electronic configuration of:\n(i) Cr3+ (iii) Cu+ (v) Co2+ (vii) Mn2+\n(ii) Pm3+ (iv) Ce4+ (vi) Lu2+ (viii) Th4+\n4.2 Why are Mn2+ compounds more stable than Fe2+ towards oxidation to their\n+3 state?\n4.3 Explain briefly how +2 state becomes more and more stable in the first half\nof the first row transition elements with increasing atomic number?\n4.4 To what extent do the electronic configurations decide the stability of\noxidation states in the first series of the transition elements?

The two series of the inner transition lanthanoids and actinoids with metals; 4f(Ce to Lu) and 5f(Th to Lr) are known as respect to their electronic lanthanoids and actinoids respectively. Configurations, oxidation states Originally the name transition metals was derived and chemical behaviour. From the fact that their chemical properties were transitional between those of s and p - block elements. Now according to IUPAC, transition metals are defined as metals which have incomplete d subshell either in neutral atom or in their ions. Zinc, cadmium and mercury of group 12 have full d10 configuration in their ground state as well as in their common oxidation states and hence, are not regarded as transition metals. However, being the end members of the 3d, 4d and 5d transition series, respectively, their chemistry is studied along with the chemistry of the transition metals. The presence of partly filled d or f orbitals in their atoms makes transition elements different from that of Reprint 2025 - 26 the non - transition elements. Hence, transition elements and their compounds are studied separately. However, the usual theory of valence as applicable to the non - transition elements can be applied successfully to the transition elements also. Various precious metals such as silver, gold and platinum and industrially important metals like iron, copper and titanium belong to the transition metals series. In this Unit, we shall first deal with the electronic configuration, occurrence and general characteristics of transition elements with special emphasis on the trends in the properties of the first row(3d) transition metals along with the preparation and properties of some important compounds. This will be followed by consideration of certain general aspects such as electronic configurations, oxidation states and chemical reactivity of the inner transition metals. THE TRANSITION ELEMENTS(d - BLOCK) 44444. 11111 Position in the The d block occupies the large middle section of the periodic table Periodic Table flanked between s and p blocks in the periodic table. The d orbitals of the penultimate energy level of atoms receive electrons giving rise to four rows of the transition metals, i. e., 3d, 4d, 5d and 6d. All these series of transition elements are shown in Table 4. 1. In general the electronic configuration of outer orbitals of these elements 44444. 22222 Electronic is(n - 1) d1 10ns1 2except for Pd where its electronic configuration is 4d105s0. Configurations The(n 1) stands for the inner d orbitals which may have one to ten of the d - Block electrons and the outermost ns orbital may have one or two electrons. However, this generalisation has several exceptions because of very Elements little energy difference between(n - 1) d and ns orbitals. Furthermore, half and completely filled sets of orbitals are relatively more stable. A consequence of this factor is reflected in the electronic configurations of Cr and Cu in the 3d series. For example, consider the case of Cr, which has 3d5 4s1 configuration instead of 3d44s2; the energy gap between the two sets(3d and 4s) of orbitals is small enough to prevent electron entering the 3d orbitals. Similarly in case of Cu, the configuration is 3d104s1 and not 3d94s2. The ground state electronic configurations of the outer orbitals of transition elements are given in Table 4. 1.

The orbitals in these elements are completely filled in the ground state as well as in their common oxidation states. Therefore, they are not regarded as transition elements. The d orbitals of the transition elements protrude to the periphery of an atom more than the other orbitals(i. e., s and p), hence, they are more influenced by the surroundings as well as affect the atoms or molecules surrounding them. In some respects, ions of a given dn configuration(n = 1 9) have similar magnetic and electronic properties. With partly filled d orbitals these elements exhibit certain characteristic properties such as display of a variety of oxidation states, formation of coloured ions and entering into complex formation with a variety of ligands. The transition metals and their compounds also exhibit catalytic property and paramagnetic behaviour. All these characteristics have been discussed in detail later in this Unit. There are greater similarities in the properties of the transition elements of a horizontal row in contrast to the non - transition elements. However, some group similarities also exist. We shall first study the general characteristics and their trends in the horizontal rows(particularly 3d row) and then consider some group similarities.

Fig. 4. 1 depicts the melting points of Nb Ru transition metals belonging to 3d, 4d and 5d Ir series. The high melting points of these metals Hf Tc are attributed to the involvement of greater Cr number of electrons from(n - 1) d in addition to Rh Zr V Pt the ns electrons in the interatomic metallic Ti Fe Co Pd bonding. In any row the melting points of these metals rise to a maximum at d5 except for Ni anomalous values of Mn and Tc and fall Mn Cu regularly as the atomic number increases. Au Ag They have high enthalpies of atomisation which are shown in Fig. 4. 2. The maxima at about Atomic number the middle of each series indicate that one Fig. 4. 1: Trends in melting points of unpaired electron per d orbital is particularly transition elements Reprint 2025 - 26 favourable for strong interatomic interaction. In general, greater the number of valence electrons, stronger is the resultant bonding. Since the enthalpy of atomisation is an important factor in determining the standard electrode potential of a metal, metals with very high enthalpy of atomisation(i. e., very high boiling point) tend to be noble in their reactions(see later for electrode potentials). Another generalisation that may be drawn from Fig. 4. 2 is that the metals of the second and third series have greater enthalpies of atomisation than the corresponding elements of the first series; this is an important factor in accounting for the occurrence of much more frequent metal metal bonding in compounds of the heavy transition metals. Fig. 4. 2 Trends in enthalpies of atomisation of transition elements 4. 3. 2 Variation in In general, ions of the same charge in a given series show progressive Atomic and decrease in radius with increasing atomic number. This is because the Ionic Sizes new electron enters a d orbital each time the nuclear charge increases of by unity. It may be recalled that the shielding effect of a d electron is Transition not that effective, hence the net electrostatic attraction between the Metals nuclear charge and the outermost electron increases and the ionic radius decreases. The same trend is observed in the atomic radii of a given series. However, the variation within a series is quite small. An interesting point emerges when atomic sizes of one series are compared with those of the corresponding elements in the other series. The curves in Fig. 4. 3 show an increase from the first(3d) to the second(4d) series of the elements but the radii of the third(5d) series are virtually the same as those of the corresponding members of the second series. This phenomenon is associated with the intervention of the 4f orbitals which must be filled before the 5d series of elements begin. The filling of 4f before 5d orbital results in a regular decrease in atomic radii called Lanthanoid contraction which essentially compensates for the expected 93 The d - and f - Block Elements 1 lom Jk / VHD a Reprint 2025 - 26 increase in atomic size with increasing atomic number. The net result of the lanthanoid contraction is that the second and the third d series exhibit similar radii(e. g., Zr 160 pm, Hf 159 pm) and have very similar physical and chemical properties much more than that expected on the basis of usual family relationship. 19 The factor responsible for the lanthanoid contraction is somewhat similar to that observed 18 in an ordinary transition series and is attributed to similar cause, i. e., the imperfect shielding of 16 one electron by another in the same set of orbitals. However, the shielding of one 4f electron by 15 another is less than that of one d electron by another, and as the nuclear charge increases along the series, there is fairly regular decrease 13 in the size of the entire 4f n orbitals. 12 Sc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zn The decrease in metallic radius coupled with Y Zr Nb Mo Tc Ru Rh Pd Ag Cd increase in atomic mass results in a general increase in the density of these elements.

Because of large number of unpaired electrons in their atoms they Solution have stronger interatomic interaction and hence stronger bonding between atoms resulting in higher enthalpies of atomisation. Intext Question 4. 2 In the series Sc(Z = 21) to Zn(Z = 30), the enthalpy of atomisation of zinc is the lowest, i. e., 126 Kj mol 1. Why? 4. 3. 3 Ionisation There is an increase in ionisation enthalpy along each series of the Enthalpies transition elements from left to right due to an increase in nuclear charge which accompanies the filling of the inner d orbitals. Table 4. 2 gives the values of the first three ionisation enthalpies of the first series of transition elements. These values show that the successive enthalpies of these elements do not increase as steeply as in the case of non - transition elements. The variation in ionisation enthalpy along a series of transition elements is much less in comparison to the variation along a period of non - transition elements. The first ionisation enthalpy, in general, increases, but the magnitude of the increase in the second and third ionisation enthalpies for the successive elements, is much higher along a series. The irregular trend in the first ionisation enthalpy of the metals of 3d series, though of little chemical significance, can be accounted for by considering that the removal of one electron alters the relative energies of 4s and 3d orbitals. You have learnt that when d - block elements form ions, ns electrons are lost before(n 1) d electrons. As we move along the period in 3d series, we see that nuclear charge increases from scandium to zinc but electrons are added to the orbital of inner subshell, i. e., 3d orbitals. These 3d electrons shield the 4s electrons from the increasing nuclear charge somewhat more effectively than the outer shell electrons can shield one another. Therefore, the atomic radii decrease less rapidly. Thus, ionization energies increase only slightly along the 3d series. The doubly or more highly charged ions have dn configurations with no 4s electrons. A general trend of increasing values of second ionisation enthalpy is expected as the effective nuclear charge increases because one d electron does not shield another electron from the influence of nuclear charge because d - orbitals differ in direction. However, the trend of steady increase in second and third ionisation enthalpy breaks for the formation of Mn2 + and Fe3 + respectively. In both the cases, ions have d5 configuration. Similar breaks occur at corresponding elements in the later transition series. The interpretation of variation in ionisation enthalpy for an electronic configuration dn is as follows: The three terms responsible for the value of ionisation enthalpy are attraction of each electron towards nucleus, repulsion between the 95 The d - and f - Block Elements Reprint 2025 - 26 electrons and the exchange energy. Exchange energy is responsible for the stabilisation of energy state. Exchange energy is approximately proportional to the total number of possible pairs of parallel spins in the degenerate orbitals. When several electrons occupy a set of degenerate orbitals, the lowest energy state corresponds to the maximum possible extent of single occupation of orbital and parallel spins(Hunds rule). The loss of exchange energy increases the stability. As the stability increases, the ionisation becomes more difficult. There is no loss of exchange energy at d6 configuration. Mn + has 3d54s1 configuration and configuration of Cr + is d5, therefore, ionisation enthalpy of Mn + is lower than Cr +. In the same way, Fe2 + has d6 configuration and Mn2 + has 3d5 configuration. Hence, ionisation enthalpy of Fe2 + is lower than the Mn2 +. In other words, we can say that the third ionisation enthalpy of Fe is lower than that of Mn. The lowest common oxidation state of these metals is + 2. To form the M2 + ions from the gaseous atoms, the sum of the first and second ionisation enthalpy is required in addition to the enthalpy of atomisation. The dominant term is the second ionisation enthalpy which shows unusually high values for Cr and Cu where M + ions have the d5 and d10 configurations respectively. The value for Zn is correspondingly low as the ionisation causes the removal of one 4s electron which results in the formation of stable d10 configuration. The trend in the third ionisation enthalpies is not complicated by the 4s orbital factor and shows the greater difficulty of removing an electron from the d5(Mn2 +) and d10(Zn2 +) ions. In general, the third ionisation enthalpies are quite high. Also the high values for third ionisation enthalpies of copper, nickel and zinc indicate why it is difficult to obtain oxidation state greater than two for these elements. Although ionisation enthalpies give some guidance concerning the relative stabilities of oxidation states, this problem is very complex and not amenable to ready generalisation. 4. 3. 4 Oxidation One of the notable features of a transition elements is the great variety States of oxidation states these may show in their compounds. Table 4. 3 lists the common oxidation states of the first row transition elements. Table 4. 3: Oxidation States of the first row Transition Metal(the most common ones are in bold types) Sc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zn + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 7 Chemistry 96 Reprint 2025 - 26 The elements which give the greatest number of oxidation states occur in or near the middle of the series. Manganese, for example, exhibits all the oxidation states from + 2 to + 7. The lesser number of oxidation states at the extreme ends stems from either too few electrons to lose or share(Sc, Ti) or too many d electrons(hence fewer orbitals available in which to share electrons with others) for higher valence(Cu, Zn). Thus, early in the series scandium(II) is virtually unknown and titanium(IV) is more stable than Ti(I) or Ti(II). At the other end, the only oxidation state of zinc is + 2(no d electrons are involved). The maximum oxidation states of reasonable stability correspond in value to the sum of the s and d electrons upto manganese(TiIVO, VVO +, 2 2 CrV1O 2, MnVIIO) followed by a rather abrupt decrease in stability of 4 4 higher oxidation states, so that the typical species to follow are FeII, I, CoII, I, NiII, Cui, II, ZnII. The variability of oxidation states, a characteristic of transition elements, arises out of incomplete filling of d orbitals in such a way that their oxidation states differ from each other by unity, e. g., VII, VI, VIV, VV. This is in contrast with the variability of oxidation states of non transition elements where oxidation states normally differ by a unit of two. An interesting feature in the variability of oxidation states of the d block elements is noticed among the groups(groups 4 through 10). Although in the p block the lower oxidation states are favoured by the heavier members(due to inert pair effect), the opposite is true in the groups of d - block. For example, in group 6, Mo(VI) and W(VI) are found to be more stable than Cr(VI). Thus Cr(VI) in the form of dichromate in acidic medium is a strong oxidising agent, whereas Moo and WO 3 3 are not. Low oxidation states are found when a complex compound has ligands capable of p - acceptor character in addition to the s - bonding. For example, in Ni(CO) and Fe(CO), the oxidation state of nickel and 4 5 iron is zero. Name a transition element which does not exhibit variable Example 44444. 33333 oxidation states.

The observed values of E and those Electrode calculated using the data of Table 4. 4 are compared in Fig. 4. 4. Potentials The unique behaviour of Cu, having a positive E V, accounts for its inability to liberate H from acids. Only oxidising acids(nitric and hot 2 concentrated sulphuric) react with Cu, the acids being reduced. The high energy to transform Cu(s) to Cu2 +(aq) is not balanced by its hydration V enthalpy. The general trend towards less negative E values across the Fig. 4. 4: Observed and calculated values for the standard electrode potentials(M2 + fi M °) of the elements Ti to Zn series is related to the general increase in the sum of the first and second V ionisation enthalpies. It is interesting to note that the value of E for Mn, Ni and Zn are more negative than expected from the trend. Why is Cr2 + reducing and Mn3 + oxidising when both have d4 configuration? Example 44444. 44444 Cr2 + is reducing as its configuration changes from d4 to d3, the latter Solution having a half - filled t level(see Unit 5). On the other hand, the change 2g from Mn3 + to Mn2 + results in the half - filled(d5) configuration which has extra stability.

Hyd 4. 3. 6 Trends in An examination of the Eo(M3 + / M2 +) values(Table 4. 2) shows the varying the M3 + / M2 + trends. The low value for Sc reflects the stability of Sc3 + which has a Standard noble gas configuration. The highest value for Zn is due to the removal Electrode of an electron from the stable d10 configuration of Zn2 +. The Potentials comparatively high value for Mn shows that Mn2 +(d5) is particularly stable, whereas comparatively low value for Fe shows the extra stability of Fe3 +(d5). The comparatively low value for V is related to the stability of V2 +(half - filled t level, Unit 5). 2g 4. 3. 7 Trends in Table 4. 5 shows the stable halides of the 3d series of transition metals. Stability of The highest oxidation numbers are achieved in Tix(tetrahalides), VF 4 5 Higher and Crf. The + 7 state for Mn is not represented in simple halides but 6 Oxidation Mno F is known, and beyond Mn no metal has a trihalide except Fex 3 3 States and Cof. The ability of fluorine to stabilise the highest oxidation state is 3 due to either higher lattice energy as in the case of Cof, or higher bond 3 enthalpy terms for the higher covalent compounds, e. g., VF and Crf. 5 6 Although V + 5 is represented only by VF, the other halides, however, 5 undergo hydrolysis to give oxohalides, VOX. Another feature of fluorides 3 is their instability in the low oxidation states e. g., VX(X = CI, Br or I) 2 Table 4. 5: Formulas of Halides of 3d Metals Oxidation Number + 6 Crf 6 + 5 VF Crf 5 5 + 4 Tix VXI Crx Mnf 4 4 4 4 + 3 Tix VX Crx Mnf FeXI Cof 3 3 3 3 3 3 + 2 Tix I VX Crx Mnx Fex Cox Nix Cux II Znx 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 + 1 CuXI Key: X = F fi I; XI = F fi Br; XII = F, CI; XI = CI fi I 99 The d - and f - Block Elements Reprint 2025 - 26 and the same applies to Cux. On the other hand, all CuII halides are known except the iodide. In this case, Cu2 + oxidises I to I: 2 2Cu2 4I Cu I s I 2 2 2 However, many copper(I) compounds are unstable in aqueous solution and undergo disproportionation. 2Cu + fi Cu2 + + Cu The stability of Cu2 +(aq) rather than Cu +(aq) is due to the much more negative D Ho of Cu2 +(aq) than Cu +, which more than hyd compensates for the second ionisation enthalpy of Cu. The ability of oxygen to stabilise the highest oxidation state is demonstrated in the oxides. The highest oxidation number in the oxides(Table 4. 6) coincides with the group number and is attained in Sc O 2 3 to Mn O. Beyond Group 7, no higher oxides of Fe above Fe O, are 2 7 2 3 known, although ferrates(VI)(Feo) 2, are formed in alkaline media but 4 they readily decompose to Fe O and O. Besides the oxides, oxocations 2 3 2 stabilise Vv as VO +, VIV as VO2 + and TiIV as TiO2 +. The ability of oxygen 2 to stabilise these high oxidation states exceeds that of fluorine. Thus the highest Mn fluoride is Mnf whereas the highest oxide is Mn O. 4 2 7 The ability of oxygen to form multiple bonds to metals explains its superiority. In the covalent oxide Mn O, each Mn is tetrahedrally 2 7 surrounded by O s including a Mn O Mn bridge. The tetrahedral[MO] n - 4 ions are known for VV, Crvl, Mnv, Mnvl and MnVII.

Intext Question 4. 5 How would you account for the irregular variation of ionisation enthalpies(first and second) in the first series of the transition elements? Chemistry 100 Reprint 2025 - 26 4. 3. 8 Chemical Transition metals vary widely in their chemical reactivity. Many of Reactivity them are sufficiently electropositive to dissolve in mineral acids, although and Eo a few are noble that is, they are unaffected by single acids. Values The metals of the first series with the exception of copper are relatively more reactive and are oxidised by 1M H +, though the actual rate at which these metals react with oxidising agents like hydrogen ion(H +) is sometimes slow. For example, titanium and vanadium, in practice, are passive to dilute non oxidising acids at room temperature. The Eo values for M2 + / M(Table 4. 2) indicate a decreasing tendency to form divalent cations across the series. This general trend towards less negative Eo values is related to the increase in the sum of the first and second ionisation enthalpies. It is interesting to note that the Eo values for Mn, Ni and Zn are more negative than expected from the general trend. Whereas the stabilities of half - filled d subshell(d5) in Mn2 + and completely filled d subshell(d10) in zinc are related to their E e values; for nickel, Eo value is related to the highest negative enthalpy of hydration. An examination of the Eo values for the redox couple M3 + / M2 +(Table 4. 2) shows that Mn3 + and Co3 + ions are the strongest oxidising agents in aqueous solutions. The ions Ti2 +, V2 + and Cr2 + are strong reducing agents and will liberate hydrogen from a dilute acid, e. g., 2 Cr2 +(aq) + 2 H +(aq) fi 2 Cr3 +(aq) + H(g) 2 Example 44444. 66666 For the first row transition metals the Eo values are: Eo V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu(M2 + / M) 1. 18 0. 91 1. 18 0. 44 0. 28 0. 25 + 0. 34 Explain the irregularity in the above values. Solution The Eo(M2 + / M) values are not regular which can be explained from the irregular variation of ionisation enthalpies(H H) and also i 1 i 2 the sublimation enthalpies which are relatively much less for manganese and vanadium. Example 44444. 77777 Why is the Eo value for the Mn3 + / Mn2 + couple much more positive than that for Cr3 + / Cr2 + or Fe3 + / Fe2 +? Explain. Solution Much larger third ionisation energy of Mn(where the required change is d5 to d4) is mainly responsible for this. This also explains why the + 3 state of Mn is of little importance. Intext Questions 4. 6 Why is the highest oxidation state of a metal exhibited in its oxide or fluoride only? 4. 7 Which is a stronger reducing agent Cr2 + or Fe2 + and why? 4. 3. 9 Magnetic When a magnetic field is applied to substances, mainly two types of Properties magnetic behaviour are observed: diamagnetism and paramagnetism. Diamagnetic substances are repelled by the applied field while the paramagnetic substances are attracted. Substances which are 101 The d - and f - Block Elements Reprint 2025 - 26 attracted very strongly are said to be ferromagnetic. In fact, ferromagnetism is an extreme form of paramagnetism. Many of the transition metal ions are paramagnetic. Paramagnetism arises from the presence of unpaired electrons, each such electron having a magnetic moment associated with its spin angular momentum and orbital angular momentum. For the compounds of the first series of transition metals, the contribution of the orbital angular momentum is effectively quenched and hence is of no significance. For these, the magnetic moment is determined by the number of unpaired electrons and is calculated by using the spin - only formula, i. e., n n 2 where n is the number of unpaired electrons and is the magnetic moment in units of Bohr magneton(BM). A single unpaired electron has a magnetic moment of 1. 73 Bohr magnetons(BM). The magnetic moment increases with the increasing number of unpaired electrons. Thus, the observed magnetic moment gives a useful indication about the number of unpaired electrons present in the atom, molecule or ion. The magnetic moments calculated from the spin - only formula and those derived experimentally for some ions of the first row transition elements are given in Table 4. 7. The experimental data are mainly for hydrated ions in solution or in the solid state.

This frequency generally lies in the visible region. The colour observed corresponds to the complementary colour of the light absorbed.

The transition metals form a large number of complex compounds. This is due to the comparatively smaller sizes of the metal ions, their high ionic charges and the availability of d orbitals for bond formation. 4. 3. 12 Catalytic The transition metals and their compounds are known for their catalytic Properties activity. This activity is ascribed to their ability to adopt multiple oxidation states and to form complexes. Vanadium(V) oxide(in Contact Process), finely divided iron(in Haber s Process), and nickel(in Catalytic Hydrogenation) are some of the examples. Catalysts at a solid surface involve the formation of bonds between reactant molecules and atoms of the surface of the catalyst(first row transition metals utilise 3d and 4s electrons for bonding). This has the effect of increasing the concentration of the reactants at the catalyst surface and also weakening of the bonds in the reacting molecules(the activation energy is lowering). Also because the transition metal ions can change their oxidation states, they become more effective as catalysts. For example, iron(I) catalyses the reaction between iodide and persulphate ions. 2 I + S O 2 fi I + 2 SO 2 2 8 2 4 An explanation of this catalytic action can be given as: 2 Fe3 + + 2 I fi 2 Fe2 + + I 2 2 Fe2 + + S O 2 fi 2 Fe3 + + 2SO 2 2 8 4 4. 3. 13 Formation Interstitial compounds are those which are formed when small atoms of like H, C or N are trapped inside the crystal lattices of metals. They are Interstitial usually non stoichiometric and are neither typically ionic nor covalent, Compounds for example, Tic, Mn N, Fe H, VH. And Tih, etc. The formulas 4 3 0 56 1. 7 quoted do not, of course, correspond to any normal oxidation state of the metal. Because of the nature of their composition, these compounds are referred to as interstitial compounds. The principal physical and chemical characteristics of these compounds are as follows:(i) They have high melting points, higher than those of pure metals.(ii) They are very hard, some borides approach diamond in hardness.(i) They retain metallic conductivity.(iv) They are chemically inert. 4. 3. 14 Alloy An alloy is a blend of metals prepared by mixing the components. Formation Alloys may be homogeneous solid solutions in which the atoms of one metal are distributed randomly among the atoms of the other. Such alloys are formed by atoms with metallic radii that are within about 15 percent of each other. Because of similar radii and other characteristics of transition metals, alloys are readily formed by these metals. The alloys so formed are hard and have often high melting points. The best known are ferrous alloys: chromium, vanadium, tungsten, molybdenum and manganese are used for the production of a variety of steels and stainless steel. Alloys of transition metals with non transition metals such as brass(copper - zinc) and bronze(copper - tin), are also of considerable industrial importance.

Solution When a particular oxidation state becomes less stable relative to other oxidation states, one lower, one higher, it is said to undergo disproportionation. For example, manganese(VI) becomes unstable relative to manganese(VII) and manganese(IV) in acidic solution. 3 MnVIO 2 + 4 H + fi 2 MnVIIO + MnIVO + 2H O 4 4 2 2 Intext Question 4. 9 Explain why Cu + ion is not stable in aqueous solutions? 44444. 44444 Some 4. 4. 1 Oxides and Oxoanions of Metals Important These oxides are generally formed by the reaction of metals with Compounds of oxygen at high temperatures. All the metals except scandium form MO oxides which are ionic. The highest oxidation number in the Transition oxides, coincides with the group number and is attained in Sc O to Elements 2 3 Mn O. Beyond group 7, no higher oxides of iron above Fe O are 2 7 2 3 known. Besides the oxides, the oxocations stabilise VV as VO +, VIV as 2 VO2 + and TiIV as TiO2 +. As the oxidation number of a metal increases, ionic character decreases. In the case of Mn, Mn O is a covalent green oil. Even Cro 2 7 3 and V O have low melting points. In these higher oxides, the acidic 2 5 character is predominant. Thus, Mn O gives HMnO and Cro gives H Cro and H Cr O. 2 7 4 3 2 4 2 2 7 V O is, however, amphoteric though mainly acidic and it gives VO 3 as 2 5 4 well as VO + salts. In vanadium there is gradual change from the basic 2 V O to less basic V O and to amphoteric V O. V O dissolves in acids 2 3 2 4 2 5 2 4 to give VO2 + salts. Similarly, V O reacts with alkalies as well as acids 2 5 to giveVO3 Andvo respectively. The well characterised Cro is basic 4 4 but Cr O is amphoteric. 2 3 Potassium dichromate K Cr O 2 2 7 Potassium dichromate is a very important chemical used in leather industry and as an oxidant for preparation of many azo compounds. Dichromates are generally prepared from chromate, which in turn are obtained by the fusion of chromite ore(Fecr O) with sodium or 2 4 potassium carbonate in free access of air. The reaction with sodium carbonate occurs as follows: 4 Fecr O + 8 Na CO + 7 O fi 8 Na Cro + 2 Fe O + 8 CO 2 4 2 3 2 2 4 2 3 2 The yellow solution of sodium chromate is filtered and acidified with sulphuric acid to give a solution from which orange sodium dichromate, Na Cr O. 2H O can be crystallised. 2 2 7 2 2Na Cro + 2 H + fi Na Cr O + 2 Na + + H O 2 4 2 2 7 2 105 The d - and f - Block Elements Reprint 2025 - 26 Sodium dichromate is more soluble than potassium dichromate.

Na Cr O + 2 Kcl fi K Cr O + 2 Nacl 2 2 7 2 2 7 Orange crystals of potassium dichromate crystallise out. The chromates and dichromates are interconvertible in aqueous solution depending upon Ph of the solution. The oxidation state of chromium in chromate and dichromate is the same. 2 Cro 2 + 2H + fi Cr O 2 + H O 4 2 7 2 Cr O 2 + 2 OH - fi 2 Cro 2 + H O 2 7 4 2 The structures of chromate ion, Cro 2 and 4 the dichromate ion, Cr O 2 2 7 are shown below. The chromate ion is tetrahedral whereas the dichromate ion consists of two tetrahedra sharing one corner with Cr O Cr bond angle of 126 °. Sodium and potassium dichromates are strong oxidising agents; the sodium salt has a greater solubility in water and is extensively used as an oxidising agent in organic chemistry. Potassium dichromate is used as a primary standard in volumetric analysis. In acidic solution, its oxidising action can be represented as follows: Cr O 2 + 14H + + 6e fi 2Cr3 + + 7H O(Eo = 1. 33V) 2 7 2 Thus, acidified potassium dichromate will oxidise iodides to iodine, sulphides to sulphur, tin(II) to tin(IV) and iron(II) salts to iron(I). The half - reactions are noted below: 6 I fi 3I + 6 e; 3 Sn2 + fi 3Sn4 + + 6 e 2 3 H S fi 6H + + 3S + 6e; 6 Fe2 + fi 6Fe3 + + 6 e 2 The full ionic equation may be obtained by adding the half - reaction for potassium dichromate to the half - reaction for the reducing agent, for e. g., Cr O 2 + 14 H + + 6 Fe2 + fi 2 Cr3 + + 6 Fe3 + + 7 H O 2 7 2 Potassium permanganate KMnO 4 Potassium permanganate is prepared by fusion of Mno with an alkali 2 metal hydroxide and an oxidising agent like KNO.

The salt is not very soluble in water 4(6. 4 g / 100 g of water at 293 K), but when heated it decomposes at 513 K. 2KMnO fi K Mno + Mno + O 4 2 4 2 2 It has two physical properties of considerable interest: its intense colour and its diamagnetism along with temperature - dependent weak paramagnetism. These can be explained by the use of molecular orbital theory which is beyond the present scope. The manganate and permanganate ions are tetrahedral; the p - bonding takes place by overlap of p orbitals of oxygen with d orbitals of manganese. The green manganate is paramagnetic because of one unpaired electron but the permanganate is diamagnetic due to the absence of unpaired electron. Acidified permanganate solution oxidises oxalates to carbon dioxide, iron(II) to iron(I), nitrites to nitrates and iodides to free iodine. The half - reactions of reductants are: COO 5 10CO + 10e 2 COO 5 Fe2 + fi 5 Fe3 + + 5e 5NO + 5H O fi 5NO + 10H + + l0e 2 2 3 10I fi 5I + 10e 2 The full reaction can be written by adding the half - reaction for KMnO to the half - reaction of the reducing agent, balancing wherever 4 necessary.

Although many reactions can be understood by consideration of redox potential, kinetics of the reaction is also an important factor. Permanganate at[H +] = 1 should oxidise water but in practice the reaction is extremely slow unless either manganese(ll) ions are present or the temperature is raised. A few important oxidising reactions of KMnO are given below: 4 1.

Uses: Besides its use in analytical chemistry, potassium permanganate is used as a favourite oxidant in preparative organic chemistry. Its uses for the bleaching of wool, cotton, silk and other textile fibres and for the decolourisation of oils are also dependent on its strong oxidising power. THE INNER TRANSITION ELEMENTS(f - BLOCK) The f - block consists of the two series, lanthanoids(the fourteen elements following lanthanum) and actinoids(the fourteen elements following actinium). Because lanthanum closely resembles the lanthanoids, it is usually included in any discussion of the lanthanoids for which the general symbol Ln is often used. Similarly, a discussion of the actinoids includes actinium besides the fourteen elements constituting the series. The lanthanoids resemble one another more closely than do the members of ordinary transition elements in any series. They have only one stable oxidation state and their chemistry provides an excellent opportunity to examine the effect of small changes in size and nuclear charge along a series of otherwise similar elements. The chemistry of the actinoids is, on the other hand, much more complicated. The complication arises partly owing to the occurrence of a wide range of oxidation states in these elements and partly because their radioactivity creates special problems in their study; the two series will be considered separately here. 44444. 55555 The The names, symbols, electronic configurations of atomic and some Lanthanoids ionic states and atomic and ionic radii of lanthanum and lanthanoids(for which the general symbol Ln is used) are given in Table 4. 9.

However, the electronic configurations of all the tripositive ions(the most stable oxidation state of all the lanthanoids) are of the form 4f n(n = 1 to 14 with increasing atomic number). 4. 5. 2 Atomic and The overall decrease in atomic and ionic radii from lanthanum to Ionic Sizes lutetium(the lanthanoid contraction) is a unique feature in the chemistry of the lanthanoids. It has far reaching consequences in the chemistry of the third + transition series of the elements. The decrease in atomic radii(derived from the structures of metals) is not quite regular as it is regular in M3 + ions(Fig. 4. 6). This contraction is, of course, similar to that observed in an ordinary transition series and is attributed to the same cause, the imperfect shielding of one electron by another in the same sub - shell. However, the shielding of one 4 f electron by another is less than one d electron by another with the increase in nuclear charge along the series. There is fairly regular decrease in the sizes with increasing atomic number. The cumulative effect of the contraction of the lanthanoid series, known as lanthanoid contraction, causes the radii of the members of the third transition series to be very similar to those of the corresponding members of the second series. The almost identical radii of Zr(160 pm) and Hf(159 pm), a consequence of the lanthanoid contraction, account for their Atomic number occurrence together in nature and for the Fig. 4. 6: Trends in ionic radii of lanthanoids difficulty faced in their separation. 4. 5. 3 Oxidation In the lanthanoids, La(II) and Ln(I) compounds are predominant States species. However, occasionally + 2 and + 4 ions in solution or in solid compounds are also obtained. This irregularity(as in ionisation enthalpies) arises mainly from the extra stability of empty, half - filled or filled f subshell. Thus, the formation of CeIV is favoured by its noble gas configuration, but it is a strong oxidant reverting to the common + 3 state. The Eo value for Ce4 + / Ce3 + is + 1. 74 V which suggests that it can oxidise water. However, the reaction rate is very slow and hence Ce(IV) is a good analytical reagent. Pr, Nd, Tb and Dy also exhibit + 4 state but only in oxides, MO. Eu2 + is formed by losing 2 the two s electrons and its f 7 configuration accounts for the formation of this ion. However, Eu2 + is a strong reducing agent changing to the common + 3 state. Similarly Yb2 + which has f 14 configuration is a reductant. TbIV has half - filled f - orbitals and is an oxidant. The behaviour of samarium is very much like europium, exhibiting both + 2 and + 3 oxidation states.

Characteristics The hardness increases with increasing atomic number, samarium being steel hard. Their melting points range between 1000 to 1200 K but samarium melts at 1623 K. They have typical metallic structure and are good conductors of heat and electricity. Density and other properties change smoothly except for Eu and Yb and occasionally for Sm and Tm. Many trivalent lanthanoid ions are coloured both in the solid state and in aqueous solutions. Colour of these ions may be attributed to the presence of f electrons. Neither La3 + nor Lu3 + ion shows any colour but the rest do so. However, absorption bands are narrow, probably because of the excitation within f level. The lanthanoid ions other than the f 0 type(La3 + and Ce4 +) and the f 14 type(Yb2 + and Lu3 +) are all paramagnetic. The first ionisation enthalpies of the lanthanoids are around 600 Kj mol 1, the second about 1200 Kj mol 1 comparable with those of calcium. A detailed discussion of the variation of the third ionisation enthalpies indicates that the exchange enthalpy considerations(as in 3d orbitals of the first transition series), appear to impart a certain degree of stability to empty, half - filled and completely filled orbitals f level. This is indicated from the abnormally low value of the third ionisation enthalpy of lanthanum, gadolinium and lutetium. In their chemical behaviour, in general, the earlier members of the series are quite reactive similar to calcium but, with increasing atomic number, they behave more like aluminium.

Their general reactions are 3 2 depicted in Fig. 4. 7. Fig 4. 7: Chemical reactions of the lanthanoids. The best single use of the lanthanoids is for the production of alloy steels for plates and pipes. A well known alloy is mischmetall which consists of a lanthanoid metal(~ 95 %) and iron(~ 5 %) and traces of S, C, Ca and Al. A good deal of mischmetall is used in Mg - based alloy to produce bullets, shell and lighter flint. Mixed oxides of lanthanoids are employed as catalysts in petroleum cracking. Some individual Ln oxides are used as phosphors in television screens and similar fluorescing surfaces. 44444. 66666 The Actinoids The actinoids include the fourteen elements from Th to Lr.

The latter members could be prepared only in nanogram quantities. These facts render their study more difficult. 4. 6. 1 Electronic All the actinoids are believed to have the electronic configuration of 7s2 Configurations and variable occupancy of the 5f and 6d subshells. The fourteen electrons are formally added to 5f, though not in thorium(Z = 90) but from Pa onwards the 5f orbitals are complete at element 103. The irregularities in the electronic configurations of the actinoids, like those in the lanthanoids are related to the stabilities of the f 0, f 7 and f 14 occupancies of the 5f orbitals. Thus, the configurations of Am and Cm are[Rn] 5f 77s2 and[Rn] 5f 76d17s2. Although the 5f orbitals resemble the 4f orbitals in their angular part of the wave - function, they are not as buried as 4f orbitals and hence 5f electrons can participate in bonding to a far greater extent. 4. 6. 2 Ionic Sizes The general trend in lanthanoids is observable in the actinoids as well. There is a gradual decrease in the size of atoms or M3 + ions across the series. This may be referred to as the actinoid contraction(like lanthanoid contraction). The contraction is, however, greater from element to element in this series resulting from poor shielding by 5f electrons. 4. 6. 3 Oxidation There is a greater range of oxidation states, which is in part attributed to States the fact that the 5f, 6d and 7s levels are of comparable energies. The known oxidation states of actinoids are listed in Table 4. 11. The actinoids show in general + 3 oxidation state. The elements, in the first half of the series frequently exhibit higher oxidation states. For example, the maximum oxidation state increases from + 4 in Th to + 5, + 6 and + 7 respectively in Pa, U and Np but decreases in succeeding elements(Table 4. 11). The actinoids resemble the lanthanoids in having more compounds in + 3 state than in the + 4 state. However, + 3 and + 4 ions tend to hydrolyse. Because the distribution of oxidation states among the actinoids is so uneven and so different for the former and later elements, it is unsatisfactory to review their chemistry in terms of oxidation states.

The structural variability is obtained and Comparison due to irregularities in metallic radii which are far greater with Lanthanoids than in lanthanoids. Chemistry 112 Reprint 2025 - 26 The actinoids are highly reactive metals, especially when finely divided. The action of boiling water on them, for example, gives a mixture of oxide and hydride and combination with most non metals takes place at moderate temperatures. Hydrochloric acid attacks all metals but most are slightly affected by nitric acid owing to the formation of protective oxide layers; alkalies have no action. The magnetic properties of the actinoids are more complex than those of the lanthanoids. Although the variation in the magnetic susceptibility of the actinoids with the number of unpaired 5 f electrons is roughly parallel to the corresponding results for the lanthanoids, the latter have higher values. It is evident from the behaviour of the actinoids that the ionisation enthalpies of the early actinoids, though not accurately known, but are lower than for the early lanthanoids. This is quite reasonable since it is to be expected that when 5f orbitals are beginning to be occupied, they will penetrate less into the inner core of electrons. The 5f electrons, will therefore, be more effectively shielded from the nuclear charge than the 4f electrons of the corresponding lanthanoids. Because the outer electrons are less firmly held, they are available for bonding in the actinoids. A comparison of the actinoids with the lanthanoids, with respect to different characteristics as discussed above, reveals that behaviour similar to that of the lanthanoids is not evident until the second half of the actinoid series. However, even the early actinoids resemble the lanthanoids in showing close similarities with each other and in gradual variation in properties which do not entail change in oxidation state. The lanthanoid and actinoid contractions, have extended effects on the sizes, and therefore, the properties of the elements succeeding them in their respective periods. The lanthanoid contraction is more important because the chemistry of elements succeeding the actinoids are much less known at the present time.

Solution Cerium(Z = 58) Intext Question 4. 10 Actinoid contraction is greater from element to element than lanthanoid contraction. Why? 44444. 77777 Some Iron and steels are the most important construction materials. Their Aplications production is based on the reduction of iron oxides, the removal of impurities and the addition of carbon and alloying metals such as Cr, Mn of d - and and Ni. Some compounds are manufactured for special purposes such as f - Block Tio for the pigment industry and Mno for use in dry battery cells. The 2 Elements battery industry also requires Zn and Ni / Cd. The elements of Group 11 are still worthy of being called the coinage metals, although Ag and Au 113 The d - and f - Block Elements Reprint 2025 - 26 are restricted to collection items and the contemporary UK copper coins are copper - coated steel. The silver UK coins are a Cu / Ni alloy. Many of the metals and / or their compounds are essential catalysts in the chemical industry. V O catalyses the oxidation of SO in the manufacture of 2 5 2 sulphuric acid. Ticl with A1(CH) forms the basis of the Ziegler catalysts 4 33 used to manufacture polyethylene(polythene). Iron catalysts are used in the Haber process for the production of ammonia from N / H mixtures. 2 2 Nickel catalysts enable the hydrogenation of fats to proceed. In the Wacker process the oxidation of ethyne to ethanal is catalysed by Pdcl. Nickel 2 complexes are useful in the polymerisation of alkynes and other organic compounds such as benzene. The photographic industry relies on the special light - sensitive properties of Agbr. Sumary The d - block consisting of Groups 3 - 12 occupies the large middle section of the periodic table. In these elements the inner d orbitals are progressively filled. The f - block is placed outside at the bottom of the periodic table and in the elements of this block, 4f and 5f orbitals are progressively filled. Corresponding to the filling of 3d, 4d and 5d orbitals, three series of transition elements are well recognised. All the transition elements exhibit typical metallic properties such as high tensile strength, ductility, malleability, thermal and electrical conductivity and metallic character. Their melting and boiling points are high which are attributed to the involvement of(n 1) d electrons resulting into strong interatomic bonding. In many of these properties, the maxima occur at about the middle of each series which indicates that one unpaired electron per d orbital is particularly a favourable configuration for strong interatomic interaction. Successive ionisation enthalpies do not increase as steeply as in the main group elements with increasing atomic number. Hence, the loss of variable number of electrons from(n 1) d orbitals is not energetically unfavourable. The involvement of(n 1) d electrons in the behaviour of transition elements impart certain distinct characteristics to these elements. Thus, in addition to variable oxidation states, they exhibit paramagnetic behaviour, catalytic properties and tendency for the formation of coloured ions, interstitial compounds and complexes. The transition elements vary widely in their chemical behaviour. Many of them are sufficiently electropositive to dissolve in mineral acids, although a few are noble. Of the first series, with the exception of copper, all the metals are relatively reactive. The transition metals react with a number of non - metals like oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur and halogens to form binary compounds. The first series transition metal oxides are generally formed from the reaction of metals with oxygen at high temperatures. These oxides dissolve in acids and bases to form oxometallic salts. Potassium dichromate and potassium permanganate are common examples. Potassium dichromate is prepared from the chromite ore by fusion with alkali in presence of air and acidifying the extract. Pyrolusite ore(Mno) is used for the preparation of potassium permanganate. Both the 2 dichromate and the permanganate ions are strong oxidising agents. The two series of inner transition elements, lanthanoids and actinoids constitute the f - block of the periodic table. With the successive filling of the inner orbitals, 4f, there is a gradual decrease in the atomic and ionic sizes of these metals along the series(lanthanoid contraction). This has far reaching consequences in the chemistry of the elements succeeding them. Lanthanum and all the lanthanoids are rather soft white metals. They react easily with water to give solutions giving + 3 ions. The principal oxidation state is + 3, although + 4 and + 2 oxidation states are also exhibited by some Chemistry 114 Reprint 2025 - 26 occasionally. The chemistry of the actinoids is more complex in view of their ability to exist in different oxidation states. Furthermore, many of the actinoid elements are radioactive which make the study of these elements rather difficult. There are many useful applications of the d - and f - block elements and their compounds, notable among them being in varieties of steels, catalysts, complexes, organic syntheses, etc. Exercises 4. 1 Write down the electronic configuration of:(i) Cr3 +(i) Cu +(v) Co2 +(vii) Mn2 +(ii) Pm3 +(iv) Ce4 +(vi) Lu2 +(vi) Th4 + 4. 2 Why are Mn2 + compounds more stable than Fe2 + towards oxidation to their + 3 state? 4. 3 Explain briefly how + 2 state becomes more and more stable in the first half of the first row transition elements with increasing atomic number? 4. 4 To what extent do the electronic configurations decide the stability of oxidation states in the first series of the transition elements?

Werner proposed the concept of a primary valence and\na secondary valence for a metal ion. Binary compounds such as\nCrCl , CoCl or PdCl have primary valence of 3, 2 and 2 respectively.\n3 2 2\nIn a series of compounds of cobalt(III) chloride with ammonia, it was\nfound that some of the chloride ions could be precipitated as AgCl on\nadding excess silver nitrate solution in cold but some remained in\nsolution.\nChemistry 118\nReprint 2025-26\n1 mol CoCl .6NH (Yellow) gave 3 mol AgCl\n3 3\n1 mol CoCl .5NH (Purple) gave 2 mol AgCl\n3 3\n1 mol CoCl .4NH (Green) gave 1 mol AgCl\n3 3\n1 mol CoCl .4NH (Violet) gave 1 mol AgCl\n3 3\nThese observations, together with the results of conductivity\nmeasurements in solution can be explained if (i) six groups in all,\neither chloride ions or ammonia molecules or both, remain bonded to\nthe cobalt ion during the reaction and (ii) the compounds are formulated\nas shown in Table 5.1, where the atoms within the square brackets\nform a single entity which does not dissociate under the reaction\nconditions. Werner proposed the term secondary valence for the\nnumber of groups bound directly to the metal ion; in each of these\nexamples the secondary valences are six.\nTable 5.1: Formulation of Cobalt(III) Chloride-Ammonia Complexes\nColour Formula Solution conductivity\ncorresponds to\nYellow [Co(NH ) ]3+3Cl– 1:3 electrolyte\n36\nPurple [CoCl(NH ) ]2+2Cl– 1:2 electrolyte\n3 5\nGreen [CoCl (NH ) ]+Cl– 1:1 electrolyte\n2 34\nViolet [CoCl (NH ) ]+Cl– 1:1 electrolyte\n2 34\nNote that the last two compounds in Table 5.1 have identical empirical\nformula, CoCl .4NH , but distinct properties. Such compounds are\n3 3\ntermed as isomers. Werner in 1898, propounded his theory of\ncoordination compounds. The main postulates are:\n1. In coordination compounds metals show two types of linkages\n(valences)-primary and secondary.\n2. The primary valences are normally ionisable and are satisfied by\nnegative ions.\n3. The secondary valences are non ionisable. These are satisfied by\nneutral molecules or negative ions. The secondary valence is equal to\nthe coordination number and is fixed for a metal.\n4. The ions/groups bound by the secondary linkages to the metal have\ncharacteristic spatial arrangements corresponding to different\ncoordination numbers.\nIn modern formulations, such spatial arrangements are called\ncoordination polyhedra. The species within the square bracket are\ncoordination entities or complexes and the ions outside the square\nbracket are called counter ions.\nHe further postulated that octahedral, tetrahedral and square planar\ngeometrical shapes are more common in coordination compounds of\ntransition metals. Thus, [Co(NH ) ]3+, [CoCl(NH ) ]2+ and [CoCl (NH ) ]+\n3 6 3 5 2 3 4\nare octahedral entities, while [Ni(CO) ] and [PtCl ]2– are tetrahedral and\n4 4\nsquare planar, respectively.\n119 Coordination Compounds\nReprint 2025-26\nOn the basis of the following observations made with aqueous solutions, EEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 55555.....11111\nassign secondary valences to metals in the following compounds:\nFormula Moles of AgCl precipitated per mole of\nthe compounds with excess AgNO\n3\n(i) PdCl .4NH 2\n2 3\n(ii) NiCl .6H O 2\n2 2\n(iii) PtCl .2HCl 0\n4\n(iv) CoCl .4NH 1\n3 3\n(v) PtCl .2NH 0\n2 3\n(i) Secondary 4 (ii) Secondary 6 SSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\n(iii) Secondary 6 (iv) Secondary 6 (v) Secondary 4\nDifference between a double salt and a complex\nBoth double salts as well as complexes are formed by the combination\nof two or more stable compounds in stoichiometric ratio.

He extended vant\nHoff’s theory of tetrahedral carbon atom and modified\nit for nitrogen. Werner showed optical and electrical differences between\ncomplex compounds based on physical measurements. In fact, Werner was\nthe first to discover optical activity in certain coordination compounds.\nHe, at the age of 29 years became a full professor at Technische\nHochschule in Zurich in 1895. Alfred Werner was a chemist and educationist.\nHis accomplishments included the development of the theory of coordination\ncompounds. This theory, in which Werner proposed revolutionary ideas about\nhow atoms and molecules are linked together, was formulated in a span of\nonly three years, from 1890 to 1893. The remainder of his career was spent\ngathering the experimental support required to validate his new ideas.

For example, the\ncentral atom/ion in the coordination entities: [NiCl (H O) ],\n2 2 4\n[CoCl(NH ) ]2+ and [Fe(CN) ]3– are Ni2+, Co3+ and Fe3+, respectively.\n3 5 6\nThese central atoms/ions are also referred to as Lewis acids.\n(c) Ligands\nThe ions or molecules bound to the central atom/ion in the\ncoordination entity are called ligands. These may be simple ions\nsuch as Cl–, small molecules such as H O or NH , larger molecules\n2 3\nsuch as H NCH CH NH or N(CH CH NH ) or even macromolecules,\n2 2 2 2 2 2 23\nsuch as proteins.\nWhen a ligand is bound to a metal ion through a single donor\natom, as with Cl–, H O or NH , the ligand is said to be unidentate.\n2 3\nWhen a ligand can bind through two donor atoms as in\nH NCH CH NH (ethane-1,2-diamine) or C O 2– (oxalate), the\n2 2 2 2 2 4\nligand is said to be didentate and when several donor atoms are\npresent in a single ligand as in N(CH CH NH ) , the ligand is said\n2 2 23\nto be polydentate. Ethylenediaminetetraacetate ion (EDTA4–) is\nan important hexadentate ligand. It can bind through two\nnitrogen and four oxygen atoms to a central metal ion.\nWhen a di- or polydentate ligand uses its two or more donor\natoms simultaneously to bind a single metal ion, it is said to be a\nchelate ligand. The number of such ligating groups is called the\ndenticity of the ligand. Such complexes, called chelate complexes\ntend to be more stable than similar complexes containing unidentate\nligands. Ligand which has two different donor atoms and either of\nthe two ligetes in the complex is called ambidentate\nligand. Examples of such ligands are the NO – and\n2\nSCN– ions. NO – ion can coordinate either through\n2\nnitrogen or through oxygen to a central metal\natom/ion.\nSimilarly, SCN– ion can coordinate through the\nsulphur or nitrogen atom.\n(d) Coordination number\nThe coordination number (CN) of a metal ion in a complex can be\ndefined as the number of ligand donor atoms to which the metal is\ndirectly bonded. For example, in the complex ions, [PtCl ]2– and\n6\n[Ni(NH ) ]2+, the coordination number of Pt and Ni are 6 and 4\n3 4\nrespectively. Similarly, in the complex ions, [Fe(C O ) ]3– and\n2 4 3\n[Co(en) ]3+, the coordination number of both, Fe and Co, is 6 because\n3\nC O 2– and en (ethane-1,2-diamine) are didentate ligands.\n2 4\n121 Coordination Compounds\nReprint 2025-26\nIt is important to note here that coordination number of the central\natom/ion is determined only by the number of sigma bonds formed by\nthe ligand with the central atom/ion. Pi bonds, if formed between the\nligand and the central atom/ion, are not counted for this purpose.\n(e) Coordination sphere\nThe central atom/ion and the ligands attached to it are enclosed in\nsquare bracket and is collectively termed as the coordination\nsphere. The ionisable groups are written outside the bracket and\nare called counter ions. For example, in the complex K [Fe(CN) ],\n4 6\nthe coordination sphere is [Fe(CN) ]4– and the counter ion is K+.\n6\n(f) Coordination polyhedron\nThe spatial arrangement of the ligand atoms which are directly\nattached to the central atom/ion defines a coordination\npolyhedron about the central atom. The most common\ncoordination polyhedra are octahedral, square planar and\ntetrahedral. For example, [Co(NH ) ]3+ is octahedral, [Ni(CO) ] is\n3 6 4\ntetrahedral and [PtCl ]2– is square planar. Fig. 5.1 shows the\n4\nshapes of different coordination polyhedra.\nFig. 5.1:Shapes of different coordination polyhedra. M\nrepresents the central atom/ion and L, a unidentate\nligand.\n(g) Oxidation number of central atom\nThe oxidation number of the central atom in a complex is defined\nas the charge it would carry if all the ligands are removed along\nwith the electron pairs that are shared with the central atom. The\noxidation number is represented by a Roman numeral in parenthesis\nfollowing the name of the coordination entity. For example, oxidation\nnumber of copper in [Cu(CN) ]3– is +1 and it is written as Cu(I).\n4\n(h)Homoleptic and heteroleptic complexes\nComplexes in which a metal is bound to only one kind of donor\ngroups, e.g., [Co(NH ) ]3+, are known as homoleptic. Complexes in\n3 6\nwhich a metal is bound to more than one kind of donor groups,\ne.g., [Co(NH ) Cl ]+, are known as heteroleptic.\n3 4 2\n55555.....33333 NNNNNooooommmmmeeeeennnnnccccclllllaaaaatttttuuuuurrrrreeeee Nomenclature is important in Coordination Chemistry because of the\nooooofffff need to have an unambiguous method of describing formulas and\nwriting systematic names, particularly when dealing with isomers. The\nCCCCCoooooooooorrrrrdddddiiiiinnnnnaaaaatttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\nformulas and names adopted for coordination entities are based on the\nCCCCCooooommmmmpppppooooouuuuunnnnndddddsssss recommendations of the International Union of Pure and Applied\nChemistry (IUPAC).\nChemistry 122\nReprint 2025-26\n5.3.1 Formulas of The formula of a compound is a shorthand tool used to provide basic\nMononuclear information about the constitution of the compound in a concise and\nCoordination convenient manner. Mononuclear coordination entities contain a single\nEntities central metal atom. The following rules are applied while writing the formulas:\n(i) The central atom is listed first.\n(ii) The ligands are then listed in alphabetical order. The placement of\na ligand in the list does not depend on its charge.\n(iii) Polydentate ligands are also listed alphabetically. In case of\nabbreviated ligand, the first letter of the abbreviation is used to\ndetermine the position of the ligand in the alphabetical order.\n(iv) The formula for the entire coordination entity, whether charged or\nnot, is enclosed in square brackets. When ligands are polyatomic,\ntheir formulas are enclosed in parentheses. Ligand abbreviations\nare also enclosed in parentheses.\n(v) There should be no space between the ligands and the metal\nwithin a coordination sphere.\n(vi) When the formula of a charged coordination entity is to be written\nNote: The 2004 IUPAC without that of the counter ion, the charge is indicated outside the\ndraft recommends that\nsquare brackets as a right superscript with the number before the\nligands will be sorted\nalphabetically, sign. For example, [Co(CN) 6 ]3–, [Cr(H 2 O) 6 ]3+, etc.\nirrespective of charge. (vii) The charge of the cation(s) is balanced by the charge of the anion(s).\n5.3.2 Naming of The names of coordination compounds are derived by following the\nMononuclear principles of additive nomenclature. Thus, the groups that surround the\nCoordination central atom must be identified in the name. They are listed as prefixes\nCompounds to the name of the central atom along with any appropriate multipliers.\nThe following rules are used when naming coordination compounds:\n(i) The cation is named first in both positively and negatively charged\ncoordination entities.\n(ii) The ligands are named in an alphabetical order before the name of the\ncentral atom/ion. (This procedure is reversed from writing formula).\n(iii) Names of the anionic ligands end in –o, those of neutral and cationic\nligands are the same except aqua for H O, ammine for NH , carbonyl\n2 3\nfor CO and nitrosyl for NO. While writing the formula of coordination\nentity, these are enclosed in brackets ( ).\n(iv) Prefixes mono, di, tri, etc., are used to indicate the number of the\nindividual ligands in the coordination entity. When the names of\nthe ligands include a numerical prefix, then the terms, bis, tris,\ntetrakis are used, the ligand to which they refer being placed in\nparentheses. For example, [NiCl (PPh ) ] is named as\n2 3 2\ndichloridobis(triphenylphosphine)nickel(II).\n(v) Oxidation state of the metal in cation, anion or neutral coordination\nentity is indicated by Roman numeral in parenthesis.\n(vi) If the complex ion is a cation, the metal is named same as the\nelement. For example, Co in a complex cation is called cobalt and\nNote: The 2004\nPt is called platinum. If the complex ion is an anion, the name of\nIUPAC draft\nrecommends that the metal ends with the suffix – ate. For example, Co in a complex\n2\nanionic ligands will anion,  CoSCN\n\n is called cobaltate. For some metals, the Latin\nend with–ido so that 4\nnames are used in the complex anions, e.g., ferrate for Fe.\nchloro would become\nchlorido, etc.\n123 Coordination Compounds\nReprint 2025-26\n(vii) The neutral complex molecule is named similar to that of the\ncomplex cation.\nThe following examples illustrate the nomenclature for coordination\ncompounds.\n1. [Cr(NH ) (H O) ]Cl is named as:\n3 3 2 3 3\ntriamminetriaquachromium(III) chloride\nExplanation: The complex ion is inside the square bracket, which is\na cation. The amine ligands are named before the aqua ligands\naccording to alphabetical order. Since there are three chloride ions in\nthe compound, the charge on the complex ion must be +3 (since the\ncompound is electrically neutral). From the charge on the complex\nion and the charge on the ligands, we can calculate the oxidation\nnumber of the metal. In this example, all the ligands are neutral\nmolecules. Therefore, the oxidation number of chromium must be\nthe same as the charge of the complex ion, +3.\n2.

The two forms are called\ndextro (d) and laevo (l) depending\nupon the direction they rotate the\nplane of polarised light in a\npolarimeter (d rotates to the right, l to\nthe left).

A simple example is provided by complexes\ncontaining the thiocyanate ligand, NCS–, which may bind through the\nnitrogen to give M–NCS or through sulphur to give M–SCN. Jørgensen\ndiscovered such behaviour in the complex [Co(NH ) (NO )]Cl , which is\n3 5 2 2\nobtained as the red form, in which the nitrite ligandis bound through\noxygen (–ONO), and as the yellow form, in which the nitrite ligand is\nbound through nitrogen (–NO ).\n2\n5.4.4 Coordination This type of isomerism arises from the interchange of ligands between\nIsomerism cationic and anionic entities of different metal ions present in a complex.\nAn example is provided by [Co(NH ) ][Cr(CN) ], in which the NH ligands\n36 6 3\nare bound to Co3+ and the CN– ligands to Cr3+. In its coordination\nisomer [Cr(NH ) ][Co(CN) ], the NH ligands are bound to Cr3+ and the\n3 6 6 3\nCN– ligands to Co3+.\n5.4.5 Ionisation This form of isomerism arises when the counter ion in a complex salt\nIsomerism is itself a potential ligand and can displace a ligand which can then\nbecome the counter ion.

Valence Bond Theory (VBT),\nCrystal Field Theory (CFT), Ligand Field Theory (LFT) and Molecular\nOrbital Theory (MOT). We shall focus our attention on elementary\ntreatment of the application of VBT and CFT to coordination compounds.\n5.5.1 Valence According to this theory, the metal atom or ion under the influence of\nBond ligands can use its (n-1)d, ns, np or ns, np, nd orbitals for hybridisation\nTheory to yield a set of equivalent orbitals of definite geometry such as octahedral,\ntetrahedral, square planar and so on (Table 5.2). These hybridised orbitals\nare allowed to overlap with ligand orbitals that can donate electron pairs\nfor bonding. This is illustrated by the following examples.\nTable 5.2: Number of Orbitals and Types of Hybridisations\nCoordination Type of Distribution of hybrid\nnumber hybridisation orbitals in space\n4 sp3 Tetrahedral\n4 dsp2 Square planar\n5 sp3d Trigonal bipyramidal\n6 sp3d2 Octahedral\n6 d2sp3 Octahedral\nChemistry 128\nReprint 2025-26\nIt is usually possible to predict the geometry of a complex from\nthe knowledge of its\nmagnetic behaviour on\nthe basis of the valence\nbond theory.\nIn the diamagnetic\noctahedral complex,\n[Co(NH ) ]3+, the cobalt ion\n3 6\nis in +3 oxidation state\nand has the electronic\nconfiguration 3d6. The\nhybridisation scheme is as\nshown in diagram.\nSix pairs of electrons, one from each NH molecule, occupy the six\n3\nhybrid orbitals. Thus, the complex has octahedral geometry and is\ndiamagnetic because of the absence of unpaired electron. In the formation\nof this complex, since the inner d orbital (3d) is used in hybridisation,\nthe complex, [Co(NH ) ]3+ is called an inner orbital or low spin or spin\n3 6\npaired complex. The paramagnetic octahedral complex, [CoF ]3– uses\n6\nouter orbital (4d ) in hybridisation (sp3d2). It is thus called outer orbital\nor high spin or spin free complex. Thus:\nOrbitals of Co3+ion\n3d 4s 4p 4d\nsp3d2hybridised\norbitals of Co3+\n3d sp3d3 hybrid\n[CoF]3–\n6\n(outer orbital or\nhigh spin complex)\n3d Six pairs of electrons\nfrom six F–ions\nIn tetrahedral complexes\none s and three p orbitals\nare hybridised to form four\nequivalent orbitals oriented\ntetrahedrally. This is ill-\nustrated below for [NiCl ]2-.\n4\nHere nickel is in +2\noxidation state and the ion\nhas the electronic\nconfiguration 3d8. The\nhybridisation scheme is as\nshown in diagram.\nEach Cl– ion donates a pair of electrons. The compound is\nparamagnetic since it contains two unpaired electrons. Similarly,\n[Ni(CO) ] has tetrahedral geometry but is diamagnetic since nickel is in\n4\nzero oxidation state and contains no unpaired electron.\n129 Coordination Compounds\nReprint 2025-26\nIn the square planar complexes, the hybridisation involved is dsp2.\nAn example is [Ni(CN) ]2–. Here nickel is in +2 oxidation state and has\n4\nthe electronic configuration 3d8. The hybridisation scheme is as shown\nin diagram:\nOrbitals of Ni2+ion\n3d 4s 4p\ndsp2hybridised\norbitals of Ni2+\n3d dsp2 hydrid 4p\n[Ni(CN)]2–\n4\n(low spin complex)\n3d Four pairs of electrons 4p\nfrom 4 CN–groups\nEach of the hybridised orbitals receives a pair of electrons from a\ncyanide ion. The compound is diamagnetic as evident from the absence\nof unpaired electron.\nIt is important to note that the hybrid orbitals do not actually exist.\nIn fact, hybridisation is a mathematical manipulation of wave equation\nfor the atomic orbitals involved.\n5.5.2 Magnetic The magnetic moment of coordination compounds can be measured\nProperties by the magnetic susceptibility experiments. The results can be used to\nof obtain information about the number of unpaired electrons and hence\nCoordination structures adopted by metal complexes.\nCompounds A critical study of the magnetic data of coordination compounds of\nmetals of the first transition series reveals some complications. For\nmetal ions with upto three electrons in the d orbitals, like Ti3+ (d1); V3+\n(d2); Cr3+ (d3); two vacant d orbitals are available for octahedral\nhybridisation with 4s and 4p orbitals. The magnetic behaviour of these\nfree ions and their coordination entities is similar. When more than\nthree 3d electrons are present, the required pair of 3d orbitals for\noctahedral hybridisation is not directly available (as a consequence of\nHund’s rule). Thus, for d4 (Cr2+, Mn3+), d5 (Mn2+, Fe3+), d6 (Fe2+, Co3+)\ncases, a vacant pair of d orbitals results only by pairing of 3d electrons\nwhich leaves two, one and zero unpaired electrons, respectively.\nThe magnetic data agree with maximum spin pairing in many cases,\nespecially with coordination compounds containing d6 ions. However,\nwith species containing d4 and d5 ions there are complications. [Mn(CN) ]3–\n6\nhas magnetic moment of two unpaired electrons while [MnCl ]3– has a\n6\nparamagnetic moment of four unpaired electrons. [Fe(CN) ]3– has magnetic\n6\nmoment of a single unpaired electron while [FeF ]3– has a paramagnetic\n6\nmoment of five unpaired electrons. [CoF ]3– is paramagnetic with four\n6\nunpaired electrons while [Co(C O ) ]3– is diamagnetic. This apparent\n2 43\nanomaly is explained by valence bond theory in terms of formation of\ninner orbital and outer orbital coordination entities. [Mn(CN) ]3–, [Fe(CN) ]3–\n6 6\nand [Co(C O ) ]3– are inner orbital complexes involving d2sp3 hybridisation,\n2 43\nthe former two complexes are paramagnetic and the latter diamagnetic.\nOn the other hand, [MnCl ]3–, [FeF ]3– and [CoF ]3– are outer orbital\n6 6 6-\ncomplexes involving sp3d2 hybridisation and are paramagnetic\ncorresponding to four, five and four unpaired electrons.\nChemistry 130\nReprint 2025-26\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 55555.....77777 The spin only magnetic moment of [MnBr ]2– is 5.9 BM. Predict the\n4\ngeometry of the complex ion ?\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn Since the coordination number of Mn2+ ion in the complex ion is 4, it\nwill be either tetrahedral (sp3 hybridisation) or square planar (dsp2\nhybridisation). But the fact that the magnetic moment of the complex\nion is 5.9 BM, it should be tetrahedral in shape rather than square\nplanar because of the presence of five unpaired electrons in the d orbitals.\n5.5.3 Limitations While the VB theory, to a larger extent, explains the formation, structures\nof Valence and magnetic behaviour of coordination compounds, it suffers from\nBond the following shortcomings:\nTheory (i) It involves a number of assumptions.\n(ii) It does not give quantitative interpretation of magnetic data.\n(iii) It does not explain the colour exhibited by coordination compounds.\n(iv) It does not give a quantitative interpretation of the thermodynamic\nor kinetic stabilities of coordination compounds.\n(v) It does not make exact predictions regarding the tetrahedral and\nsquare planar structures of 4-coordinate complexes.\n(vi) It does not distinguish between weak and strong ligands.\n5.5.4 Crystal The crystal field theory (CFT) is an electrostatic model which considers\nField the metal-ligand bond to be ionic arising purely from electrostatic\nTheory interactions between the metal ion and the ligand. Ligands are treated\nas point charges in case of anions or point dipoles in case of neutral\nmolecules. The five d orbitals in an isolated gaseous metal atom/ion\nhave same energy, i.e., they are degenerate. This degeneracy is\nmaintained if a spherically symmetrical field of negative charges\nsurrounds the metal atom/ion. However, when this negative field is\ndue to ligands (either anions or the negative ends of dipolar molecules\nlike NH and H O) in a complex, it becomes asymmetrical and the\n3 2\ndegeneracy of the d orbitals is lifted. It results in splitting of the d\norbitals. The pattern of splitting depends upon the nature of the crystal\nfield. Let us explain this splitting in different crystal fields.\n(a) Crystal field splitting in octahedral coordination entities\nIn an octahedral coordination entity with six ligands surrounding\nthe metal atom/ion, there will be repulsion between the electrons in\nmetal d orbitals and the electrons (or negative charges) of the ligands.\nSuch a repulsion is more when the metal d orbital is directed towards\nthe ligand than when it is away from the ligand. Thus, the d\nx2y2\nandd orbitals which point towards the axes along the direction of\nz2\nthe ligand will experience more repulsion and will be raised in\nenergy; and the d , d and d orbitals which are directed between\nxy yz xz\nthe axes will be lowered in energy relative to the average energy in\nthe spherical crystal field. Thus, the degeneracy of the d orbitals\nhas been removed due to ligand electron-metal electron repulsions\nin the octahedral complex to yield three orbitals of lower energy, t\n2g\nset and two orbitals of higher energy, e set. This splitting of the\ng\n131 Coordination Compounds\nReprint 2025-26\ndegenerate levels due to the\npresence of ligands in a\ndefinite geometry is termed as\ncrystal field splitting and\nthe energy separation is\ndenoted by D (the subscript\no\no is for octahedral) (Fig.5.8).\nThus, the energy of the two e\ng\norbitals will increase by (3/5)\nD and that of the three t will\no 2g\ndecrease by (2/5)D .\no\nThe crystal field splitting,\nD , depends upon the field\no\nproduced by the ligand and\ncharge on the metal ion. Some\nligands are able to produce\nstrong fields in which case, the\nsplitting will be large whereas\nothers produce weak fields\nFig.5.8: d orbital splitting in an octahedral crystal field\nand consequently result in\nsmall splitting of d orbitals.\nIn general, ligands can be arranged in a series in the order of increasing\nfield strength as given below:\nI– < Br– < SCN– < Cl– < S2– < F– < OH– < C O 2– < H O < NCS–\n2 4 2\n< edta4– < NH < en < CN– < CO\n3\nSuch a series is termed as spectrochemical series. It is an\nexperimentally determined series based on the absorption of light\nby complexes with different ligands. Let us assign electrons in the d\norbitals of metal ion in octahedral coordination entities. Obviously,\nthe single d electron occupies one of the lower energy t orbitals. In\n2g\nd2 and d3 coordination entities, the d electrons occupy the t orbitals\n2g\nsingly in accordance with the Hund’s rule. For d4 ions, two possible\npatterns of electron distribution arise: (i) the fourth electron could\neither enter the t level and pair with an existing electron, or (ii) it\n2g\ncould avoid paying the price of the pairing energy by occupying the\ne level. Which of these possibilities occurs, depends on the relative\ng\nmagnitude of the crystal field splitting, D and the pairing energy, P\no\n(P represents the energy required for electron pairing in a single\norbital). The two options are:\n(i) If D < P, the fourth electron enters one of the e orbitals giving the\no g\nconfiguration t3 e1. Ligands for which D < P are known as weak\n2g g o\nfield ligands and form high spin complexes.\n(ii) If D > P, it becomes more energetically favourable for the fourth\no\nelectron to occupy a t orbital with configuration t 4e 0. Ligands\n2g 2g g\nwhich produce this effect are known as strong field ligands and\nform low spin complexes.\nCalculations show that d4 to d7 coordination entities are more\nstable for strong field as compared to weak field cases.\nChemistry 132\nReprint 2025-26\n(b) Crystal field splitting in tetrahedral coordination entities\nIn tetrahedral coordination entity formation,\nthe d orbital splitting (Fig. 5.9) is inverted\nand is smaller as compared to the octahedral\nfield splitting. For the same metal, the same\nligands and metal-ligand distances, it can\nbe shown that D = (4/9) D . Consequently,\nt 0\nthe orbital splitting energies are not\nsufficiently large for forcing pairing and,\ntherefore, low spin configurations are rarely\nobserved. The ‘g’ subscript is used for the\noctahedral and square planar complexes\nwhich have centre of symmetry. Since\nFig.5.9: d orbital splitting in a tetrahedral\ntetrahedral complexes lack symmetry, ‘g’\ncrystal field.\nsubscript is not used with energy levels.\n5.5.5 Colour in In the previous Unit, we learnt that one of the most distinctive\nCoordination properties of transition metal complexes is their wide range of colours.\nCompounds This means that some of the visible spectrum is being removed from\nwhite light as it passes through the sample, so the light that emerges\nis no longer white. The colour of the complex is complementary to\nthat which is absorbed. The complementary colour is the colour\ngenerated from the wavelength left over; if green light is absorbed by\nthe complex, it appears red. Table 5.3 gives the relationship of the\ndifferent wavelength absorbed and the colour observed.\nTable 5.3:Relationship between the Wavelength of Light absorbed and the\nColour observed in some Coordination Entities\nCoordinaton Wavelength of light Colour of light Colour of coordination\nentity absorbed (nm) absorbed entity\n[CoCl(NH ) ]2+ 535 Yellow Violet\n3 5\n[Co(NH ) (H O)]3+ 500 Blue Green Red\n35 2\n[Co(NH ) ]3+ 475 Blue Yellow Orange\n36\n[Co(CN) ]3– 310 Ultraviolet Not in visible Pale Yellow\n6 region\n[Cu(H O) ]2+ 600 Red Blue\n2 4\n[Ti(H O) ]3+ 498 Blue Green Violet\n2 6\nThe colour in the coordination compounds can be readily explained\nin terms of the crystal field theory. Consider, for example, the complex\n[Ti(H O) ]3+, which is violet in colour. This is an octahedral complex\n2 6\nwhere the single electron (Ti3+ is a 3d1 system) in the metal d orbital is\nin the t level in the ground state of the complex. The next higher state\n2g\navailable for the electron is the empty e level. If light corresponding to\ng\nthe energy of blue-green region is absorbed by the complex, it would\nexcite the electron from t level to the e level (t 1e 0 fi t 0e 1).\n2g g 2g g 2g g\nConsequently, the complex appears violet in colour (Fig. 5.10). The\ncrystal field theory attributes the colour of the coordination compounds\nto d-d transition of the electron.\n133 Coordination Compounds\nReprint 2025-26\nIt is important to note that\nin the absence of ligand,\ncrystal field splitting does\nnot occur and hence the\nsubstance is colourless.

However, from the assumptions that the ligands are\nTheory point charges, it follows that anionic ligands should exert the greatest\nsplitting effect. The anionic ligands actually are found at the low end\nof the spectrochemical series. Further, it does not take into account\nthe covalent character of bonding between the ligand and the central\natom.

Examples are: cis–platin and related compounds.\nSSSSSuuuuummmmmmmmmmaaaaarrrrryyyyy\nThe chemistry of coordination compounds is an important and challenging\narea of modern inorganic chemistry. During the last fifty years, advances in this\narea, have provided development of new concepts and models of bonding and\nmolecular structure, novel breakthroughs in chemical industry and vital\ninsights into the functioning of critical components of biological systems.\nThe first systematic attempt at explaining the formation, reactions, structure\nand bonding of a coordination compound was made by A. Werner. His theory\npostulated the use of two types of linkages (primary and secondary) by a\nmetal atom/ion in a coordination compound. In the modern language of chemistry\nthese linkages are recognised as the ionisable (ionic) and non-ionisable (covalent)\nbonds, respectively. Using the property of isomerism, Werner predicted the\ngeometrical shapes of a large number of coordination entities.\nThe Valence Bond Theory (VBT) explains with reasonable success, the\nformation, magnetic behaviour and geometrical shapes of coordination compounds.\nIt, however, fails to provide a quantitative interpretation of magnetic behaviour\nand has nothing to say about the optical properties of these compounds.\nThe Crystal Field Theory (CFT) to coordination compounds is based on\nthe effect of different crystal fields (provided by the ligands taken as point charges),\n137 Coordination Compounds\nReprint 2025-26\non the degeneracy of d orbital energies of the central metal atom/ion. The\nsplitting of the d orbitals provides different electronic arrangements in strong\nand weak crystal fields. The treatment provides for quantitative estimations of\norbital separation energies, magnetic moments and spectral and stability\nparameters. However, the assumption that ligands consititute point charges\ncreates many theoretical difficulties.\nThe metal–carbon bond in metal carbonyls possesses both s and p character.\nThe ligand to metal is s bond and metal to ligand is p bond. This unique synergic\nbonding provides stability to metal carbonyls.\nCoordination compounds are of great importance. These compounds provide\ncritical insights into the functioning and structures of vital components of\nbiological systems. Coordination compounds also find extensive applications in\nmetallurgical processes, analytical and medicinal chemistry.\nExercises\n5.1 Explain the bonding in coordination compounds in terms of Werner’s postulates.\n5.2 FeSO solution mixed with (NH ) SO solution in 1:1 molar ratio gives the\n4 4 2 4\ntest of Fe2+ ion but CuSO solution mixed with aqueous ammonia in 1:4\n4\nmolar ratio does not give the test of Cu2+ ion.

Coordination entity, central atom / ion, ligand, coordination number, coordination sphere, coordination In the previous Unit we learnt that the transition metals polyhedron, oxidation number, form a large number of complex compounds in which homoleptic and heteroleptic; the metal atoms are bound to a number of anions or learn the rules of nomenclature neutral molecules by sharing of electrons. In modern of coordination compounds; terminology such compounds are called coordination write the formulas and names compounds. The chemistry of coordination compounds of mononuclear coordination is an important and challenging area of modern compounds; inorganic chemistry. New concepts of chemical bonding define different types of isomerism and molecular structure have provided insights into in coordination compounds; the functioning of these compounds as vital components understand the nature of bonding of biological systems. Chlorophyll, haemoglobin and in coordination compounds in vitamin B are coordination compounds of magnesium, terms of the Valence Bond and 12 iron and cobalt respectively. Variety of metallurgical Crystal Field theories; processes, industrial catalysts and analytical reagents appreciate the importance and involve the use of coordination compounds. Applications of coordination compounds in our day to day life. Coordination compounds also find many applications in electroplating, textile dyeing and medicinal chemistry. 55555. 11111 Werner s Alfred Werner(1866 - 1919), a Swiss chemist was the first to formulate his ideas about the structures of coordination compounds. He prepared Theory of and characterised a large number of coordination compounds and Cordination studied their physical and chemical behaviour by simple experimental Compounds techniques. Werner proposed the concept of a primary valence and a secondary valence for a metal ion. Binary compounds such as Crcl, Cocl or Pdcl have primary valence of 3, 2 and 2 respectively. 3 2 2 In a series of compounds of cobalt(I) chloride with ammonia, it was found that some of the chloride ions could be precipitated as Agcl on adding excess silver nitrate solution in cold but some remained in solution. Chemistry 118 Reprint 2025 - 26 1 mol Cocl. 6NH(Yellow) gave 3 mol Agcl 3 3 1 mol Cocl. 5NH(Purple) gave 2 mol Agcl 3 3 1 mol Cocl. 4NH(Green) gave 1 mol Agcl 3 3 1 mol Cocl. 4NH(Violet) gave 1 mol Agcl 3 3 These observations, together with the results of conductivity measurements in solution can be explained if(i) six groups in all, either chloride ions or ammonia molecules or both, remain bonded to the cobalt ion during the reaction and(ii) the compounds are formulated as shown in Table 5. 1, where the atoms within the square brackets form a single entity which does not dissociate under the reaction conditions. Werner proposed the term secondary valence for the number of groups bound directly to the metal ion; in each of these examples the secondary valences are six. Table 5. 1: Formulation of Cobalt(I) Chloride - Ammonia Complexes Colour Formula Solution conductivity corresponds to Yellow[Co(NH)] 3 + 3Cl 1: 3 electrolyte 36 Purple[Cocl(NH)] 2 + 2Cl 1: 2 electrolyte 3 5 Green[Cocl(NH)] + Cl 1: 1 electrolyte 2 34 Violet[Cocl(NH)] + Cl 1: 1 electrolyte 2 34 Note that the last two compounds in Table 5. 1 have identical empirical formula, Cocl. 4NH, but distinct properties. Such compounds are 3 3 termed as isomers. Werner in 1898, propounded his theory of coordination compounds. The main postulates are: 1. In coordination compounds metals show two types of linkages(valences) - primary and secondary. 2. The primary valences are normally ionisable and are satisfied by negative ions. 3. The secondary valences are non ionisable. These are satisfied by neutral molecules or negative ions. The secondary valence is equal to the coordination number and is fixed for a metal. 4. The ions / groups bound by the secondary linkages to the metal have characteristic spatial arrangements corresponding to different coordination numbers. In modern formulations, such spatial arrangements are called coordination polyhedra. The species within the square bracket are coordination entities or complexes and the ions outside the square bracket are called counter ions. He further postulated that octahedral, tetrahedral and square planar geometrical shapes are more common in coordination compounds of transition metals. Thus,[Co(NH)] 3 +,[Cocl(NH)] 2 + and[Cocl(NH)] + 3 6 3 5 2 3 4 are octahedral entities, while[Ni(CO)] and[Ptcl] 2 are tetrahedral and 4 4 square planar, respectively. 119 Coordination Compounds Reprint 2025 - 26 On the basis of the following observations made with aqueous solutions, Example 55555. 11111 assign secondary valences to metals in the following compounds: Formula Moles of Agcl precipitated per mole of the compounds with excess AgNO 3(i) Pdcl. 4NH 2 2 3(ii) Nicl. 6H O 2 2 2(i) Ptcl. 2HCl 0 4(iv) Cocl. 4NH 1 3 3(v) Ptcl. 2NH 0 2 3(i) Secondary 4(ii) Secondary 6 Solution(i) Secondary 6(iv) Secondary 6(v) Secondary 4 Difference between a double salt and a complex Both double salts as well as complexes are formed by the combination of two or more stable compounds in stoichiometric ratio. However, they differ in the fact that double salts such as carnallite, Kcl. Mgcl. 6H O, 2 2 Mohr s salt, FeSO.(NH) SO. 6H O, potash alum, Kal(SO). 12H O, etc. 4 4 2 4 2 4 2 2 dissociate into simple ions completely when dissolved in water. However, complex ions such as[Fe(CN)] 4 of K[Fe(CN)] do not dissociate into 6 4 6 Fe2 + and CN ions. Werner was born on December 12, 1866, in Mülhouse, a small community in the French province of Alsace. His study of chemistry began in Karlsruhe(Germany) and continued in Zurich(Switzerland), where in his doctoral thesis in 1890, he explained the difference in properties of certain nitrogen containing organic(((((11111888886666666666 - 11111999991111199999))))) substances on the basis of isomerism. He extended vant Hoff s theory of tetrahedral carbon atom and modified it for nitrogen. Werner showed optical and electrical differences between complex compounds based on physical measurements. In fact, Werner was the first to discover optical activity in certain coordination compounds. He, at the age of 29 years became a full professor at Technische Hochschule in Zurich in 1895. Alfred Werner was a chemist and educationist. His accomplishments included the development of the theory of coordination compounds. This theory, in which Werner proposed revolutionary ideas about how atoms and molecules are linked together, was formulated in a span of only three years, from 1890 to 1893. The remainder of his career was spent gathering the experimental support required to validate his new ideas. Werner became the first Swiss chemist to win the Nobel Prize in 1913 for his work on the linkage of atoms and the coordination theory. Chemistry 120 Reprint 2025 - 26 55555. 22222 Definitions of(a) Coordination entity A coordination entity constitutes a central metal atom or ion bonded Some to a fixed number of ions or molecules. For example,[Cocl(NH)] Important 3 3 3 is a coordination entity in which the cobalt ion is surrounded by Terms three ammonia molecules and three chloride ions. Other examples are[Ni(CO)],[Ptcl(NH)],[Fe(CN)] 4,[Co(NH)] 3 +. Pertaining to 4 2 3 2 6 3 6(b) Central atom / ion Cordination In a coordination entity, the atom / ion to which a fixed number Compounds of ions / groups are bound in a definite geometrical arrangement around it, is called the central atom or ion. For example, the central atom / ion in the coordination entities:[Nicl(H O)], 2 2 4[Cocl(NH)] 2 + and[Fe(CN)] 3 are Ni2 +, Co3 + and Fe3 +, respectively. 3 5 6 These central atoms / ions are also referred to as Lewis acids.(c) Ligands The ions or molecules bound to the central atom / ion in the coordination entity are called ligands. These may be simple ions such as Cl, small molecules such as H O or NH, larger molecules 2 3 such as H NCH CH NH or N(CH CH NH) or even macromolecules, 2 2 2 2 2 2 23 such as proteins. When a ligand is bound to a metal ion through a single donor atom, as with Cl, H O or NH, the ligand is said to be unidentate. 2 3 When a ligand can bind through two donor atoms as in H NCH CH NH(ethane - 1, 2 - diamine) or C O 2(oxalate), the 2 2 2 2 2 4 ligand is said to be didentate and when several donor atoms are present in a single ligand as in N(CH CH NH), the ligand is said 2 2 23 to be polydentate. Ethylenediaminetetraacetate ion(EDTA4) is an important hexadentate ligand. It can bind through two nitrogen and four oxygen atoms to a central metal ion. When a di - or polydentate ligand uses its two or more donor atoms simultaneously to bind a single metal ion, it is said to be a chelate ligand. The number of such ligating groups is called the denticity of the ligand. Such complexes, called chelate complexes tend to be more stable than similar complexes containing unidentate ligands. Ligand which has two different donor atoms and either of the two ligetes in the complex is called ambidentate ligand. Examples of such ligands are the NO and 2 SCN ions. NO ion can coordinate either through 2 nitrogen or through oxygen to a central metal atom / ion. Similarly, SCN ion can coordinate through the sulphur or nitrogen atom.(d) Coordination number The coordination number(CN) of a metal ion in a complex can be defined as the number of ligand donor atoms to which the metal is directly bonded. For example, in the complex ions,[Ptcl] 2 and 6[Ni(NH)] 2 +, the coordination number of Pt and Ni are 6 and 4 3 4 respectively. Similarly, in the complex ions,[Fe(C O)] 3 and 2 4 3[Co(en)] 3 +, the coordination number of both, Fe and Co, is 6 because 3 C O 2 and en(ethane - 1, 2 - diamine) are didentate ligands. 2 4 121 Coordination Compounds Reprint 2025 - 26 It is important to note here that coordination number of the central atom / ion is determined only by the number of sigma bonds formed by the ligand with the central atom / ion. Pi bonds, if formed between the ligand and the central atom / ion, are not counted for this purpose.(e) Coordination sphere The central atom / ion and the ligands attached to it are enclosed in square bracket and is collectively termed as the coordination sphere. The ionisable groups are written outside the bracket and are called counter ions. For example, in the complex K[Fe(CN)], 4 6 the coordination sphere is[Fe(CN)] 4 and the counter ion is K +. 6(f) Coordination polyhedron The spatial arrangement of the ligand atoms which are directly attached to the central atom / ion defines a coordination polyhedron about the central atom. The most common coordination polyhedra are octahedral, square planar and tetrahedral. For example,[Co(NH)] 3 + is octahedral,[Ni(CO)] is 3 6 4 tetrahedral and[Ptcl] 2 is square planar. Fig. 5. 1 shows the 4 shapes of different coordination polyhedra. Fig. 5. 1: Shapes of different coordination polyhedra. M represents the central atom / ion and L, a unidentate ligand.(g) Oxidation number of central atom The oxidation number of the central atom in a complex is defined as the charge it would carry if all the ligands are removed along with the electron pairs that are shared with the central atom. The oxidation number is represented by a Roman numeral in parenthesis following the name of the coordination entity. For example, oxidation number of copper in[Cu(CN)] 3 is + 1 and it is written as Cu(I). 4(h) Homoleptic and heteroleptic complexes Complexes in which a metal is bound to only one kind of donor groups, e. g.,[Co(NH)] 3 +, are known as homoleptic. Complexes in 3 6 which a metal is bound to more than one kind of donor groups, e. g.,[Co(NH) Cl] +, are known as heteroleptic. 3 4 2 55555. 33333 Nomenclature Nomenclature is important in Coordination Chemistry because of the of need to have an unambiguous method of describing formulas and writing systematic names, particularly when dealing with isomers. The Cordination formulas and names adopted for coordination entities are based on the Compounds recommendations of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry(IUPAC).

The following rules are applied while writing the formulas:(i) The central atom is listed first.(ii) The ligands are then listed in alphabetical order. The placement of a ligand in the list does not depend on its charge.(i) Polydentate ligands are also listed alphabetically. In case of abbreviated ligand, the first letter of the abbreviation is used to determine the position of the ligand in the alphabetical order.(iv) The formula for the entire coordination entity, whether charged or not, is enclosed in square brackets. When ligands are polyatomic, their formulas are enclosed in parentheses. Ligand abbreviations are also enclosed in parentheses.(v) There should be no space between the ligands and the metal within a coordination sphere.(vi) When the formula of a charged coordination entity is to be written Note: The 2004 IUPAC without that of the counter ion, the charge is indicated outside the draft recommends that square brackets as a right superscript with the number before the ligands will be sorted alphabetically, sign. For example,[Co(CN) 6] 3,[Cr(H 2 O) 6] 3 +, etc. Irrespective of charge.(vii) The charge of the cation(s) is balanced by the charge of the anion(s). 5. 3. 2 Naming of The names of coordination compounds are derived by following the Mononuclear principles of additive nomenclature. Thus, the groups that surround the Coordination central atom must be identified in the name. They are listed as prefixes Compounds to the name of the central atom along with any appropriate multipliers. The following rules are used when naming coordination compounds:(i) The cation is named first in both positively and negatively charged coordination entities.(ii) The ligands are named in an alphabetical order before the name of the central atom / ion.(This procedure is reversed from writing formula).(i) Names of the anionic ligands end in o, those of neutral and cationic ligands are the same except aqua for H O, ammine for NH, carbonyl 2 3 for CO and nitrosyl for NO. While writing the formula of coordination entity, these are enclosed in brackets().(iv) Prefixes mono, di, tri, etc., are used to indicate the number of the individual ligands in the coordination entity. When the names of the ligands include a numerical prefix, then the terms, bis, tris, tetrakis are used, the ligand to which they refer being placed in parentheses. For example,[Nicl(Pph)] is named as 2 3 2 dichloridobis(triphenylphosphine) nickel(II).(v) Oxidation state of the metal in cation, anion or neutral coordination entity is indicated by Roman numeral in parenthesis.(vi) If the complex ion is a cation, the metal is named same as the element. For example, Co in a complex cation is called cobalt and Note: The 2004 Pt is called platinum. If the complex ion is an anion, the name of IUPAC draft recommends that the metal ends with the suffix ate. For example, Co in a complex 2 anionic ligands will anion, Co SCN is called cobaltate. For some metals, the Latin end with ido so that 4 names are used in the complex anions, e. g., ferrate for Fe. Chloro would become chlorido, etc. 123 Coordination Compounds Reprint 2025 - 26(vii) The neutral complex molecule is named similar to that of the complex cation. The following examples illustrate the nomenclature for coordination compounds. 1.[Cr(NH)(H O)] Cl is named as: 3 3 2 3 3 triamminetriaquachromium(I) chloride Explanation: The complex ion is inside the square bracket, which is a cation. The amine ligands are named before the aqua ligands according to alphabetical order. Since there are three chloride ions in the compound, the charge on the complex ion must be + 3(since the compound is electrically neutral). From the charge on the complex ion and the charge on the ligands, we can calculate the oxidation number of the metal. In this example, all the ligands are neutral molecules. Therefore, the oxidation number of chromium must be the same as the charge of the complex ion, + 3. 2.[Co(H NCH CH NH)](SO) is named as: 2 2 2 232 43 tris(ethane - 1, 2 diamine) cobalt(I) sulphate Explanation: The sulphate is the counter anion in this molecule. Since it takes 3 sulphates to bond with two complex cations, the charge on each complex cation must be + 3. Further, ethane - 1, 2 Notice how the name diamine is a neutral molecule, so the oxidation number of cobalt of the metal differs in in the complex ion must be + 3. Remember that you never have to cation and anion even indicate the number of cations and anions in the name of an though they contain the same metal ions.

Because of the different arrangement of atoms, they differ in one or more physical or chemical Compounds properties. Two principal types of isomerism are known among coordination compounds. Each of which can be further subdivided.(a) Stereoisomerism(i) Geometrical isomerism(ii) Optical isomerism(b) Structural isomerism(i) Linkage isomerism(ii) Coordination isomerism(i) Ionisation isomerism(iv) Solvate isomerism Stereoisomers have the same chemical formula and chemical bonds but they have different spatial arrangement. Structural isomers have different bonds. A detailed account of these isomers are given below. 5. 4. 1 Geometric Isomerism This type of isomerism arises in heteroleptic complexes due to different possible geometric arrangements of the ligands. Important examples of this behaviour are found with coordination numbers 4 and 6. In a square planar complex of formula[MX L](X and L are unidentate), the 2 2 two ligands X may be arranged adjacent to each Fig. 5. 2: Geometrical isomers(cis and trans) other in a cis isomer, or opposite to each other of Pt[NH) Cl] 32 2 in a trans isomer as depicted in Fig. 5. 2. + + Other square planar complex of the type Cl Cl MABXL(where A, B, X, L are unidentates) NH 3 Cl NH 3 NH 3 shows three isomers - two cis and one trans. Co Co You may attempt to draw these structures. NH NH NH NH 3 3 3 3 Such isomerism is not possible for a tetrahedral NH Cl geometry but similar behaviour is possible in 3 cis trans octahedral complexes of formula[MX L] in 2 4 which the two ligands X may be oriented cis or Fig. 5. 3: Geometrical isomers(cis and trans) trans to each other(Fig. 5. 3). Of[Co(NH) Cl] + 34 2 125 Coordination Compounds Reprint 2025 - 26 This type of isomerism also arises when didentate ligands L L[e. g., NH CH CH NH(en)] 2 2 2 2 are present in complexes of formula[MX(L L)](Fig. 5. 4). 2 2 Another type of geometrical isomerism occurs in octahedral Fig. 5. 4: Geometrical isomers(cis and trans) coordination entities of the type of[Cocl(en)] 2 2[Ma b] like[Co(NH)(NO)]. If 3 3 3 3 2 3 three donor atoms of the same ligands occupy adjacent positions at the corners of an octahedral face, we have the facial(fac) Fig. 5. 5 The facial(fac) and isomer. When the positions are meridional(mer) around the meridian of the isomers of octahedron, we get the meridional[Co(NH)(NO)](mer) isomer(Fig. 5. 5). 3 3 2 3 Why is geometrical isomerism not possible in tetrahedral complexes Example 55555. 44444 having two different types of unidentate ligands coordinated with the central metal ion? Tetrahedral complexes do not show geometrical isomerism because Solution the relative positions of the unidentate ligands attached to the central metal atom are the same with respect to each other. 5. 4. 2 Optical Isomerism Optical isomers are mirror images that cannot be superimposed on one another. These are called as enantiomers. The molecules or ions that cannot be superimposed are called chiral. The two forms are called dextro(d) and laevo(l) depending upon the direction they rotate the plane of polarised light in a polarimeter(d rotates to the right, l to the left). Optical isomerism is common in octahedral complexes involving Fig. 5. 6: Optical isomers(d and l) of[Co(en)] 3 + didentate ligands(Fig. 5. 6). 3 In a coordination entity of the type[Ptcl(en)] 2 +, only the 2 2 cis - isomer shows optical activity(Fig. 5. 7).

A simple example is provided by complexes containing the thiocyanate ligand, NCS, which may bind through the nitrogen to give M NCS or through sulphur to give M SCN. Jørgensen discovered such behaviour in the complex[Co(NH)(NO)] Cl, which is 3 5 2 2 obtained as the red form, in which the nitrite ligandis bound through oxygen(ONO), and as the yellow form, in which the nitrite ligand is bound through nitrogen(NO). 2 5. 4. 4 Coordination This type of isomerism arises from the interchange of ligands between Isomerism cationic and anionic entities of different metal ions present in a complex. An example is provided by[Co(NH)][Cr(CN)], in which the NH ligands 36 6 3 are bound to Co3 + and the CN ligands to Cr3 +. In its coordination isomer[Cr(NH)][Co(CN)], the NH ligands are bound to Cr3 + and the 3 6 6 3 CN ligands to Co3 +. 5. 4. 5 Ionisation This form of isomerism arises when the counter ion in a complex salt Isomerism is itself a potential ligand and can displace a ligand which can then become the counter ion. An example is provided by the ionisation isomers[Co(NH)(SO)] Br and[Co(NH) Br] SO. 3 5 4 35 4 127 Coordination Compounds Reprint 2025 - 26 5. 4. 6 Solvate This form of isomerism is known as hydrate isomerism in case where Isomerism water is involved as a solvent. This is similar to ionisation isomerism. Solvate isomers differ by whether or not a solvent molecule is directly bonded to the metal ion or merely present as free solvent moleculesin the crystal lattice. An example is provided by the aqua complex[Cr(H O)] Cl(violet) and its solvate isomer[Cr(H O) Cl] Cl. H O 2 6 3 2 5 2 2(grey - green).

But his theory could not answer basic questions like:(i) Why only certain elements possess the remarkable property of Compounds forming coordination compounds?(ii) Why the bonds in coordination compounds have directional properties?(i) Why coordination compounds have characteristic magnetic and optical properties? Many approaches have been put forth to explain the nature of bonding in coordination compounds viz. Valence Bond Theory(VBT), Crystal Field Theory(CFT), Ligand Field Theory(LFT) and Molecular Orbital Theory(MOT). We shall focus our attention on elementary treatment of the application of VBT and CFT to coordination compounds. 5. 5. 1 Valence According to this theory, the metal atom or ion under the influence of Bond ligands can use its(n - 1) d, ns, np or ns, np, nd orbitals for hybridisation Theory to yield a set of equivalent orbitals of definite geometry such as octahedral, tetrahedral, square planar and so on(Table 5. 2). These hybridised orbitals are allowed to overlap with ligand orbitals that can donate electron pairs for bonding. This is illustrated by the following examples. Table 5. 2: Number of Orbitals and Types of Hybridisations Coordination Type of Distribution of hybrid number hybridisation orbitals in space 4 sp3 Tetrahedral 4 dsp2 Square planar 5 sp3d Trigonal bipyramidal 6 sp3d2 Octahedral 6 d2sp3 Octahedral Chemistry 128 Reprint 2025 - 26 It is usually possible to predict the geometry of a complex from the knowledge of its magnetic behaviour on the basis of the valence bond theory. In the diamagnetic octahedral complex,[Co(NH)] 3 +, the cobalt ion 3 6 is in + 3 oxidation state and has the electronic configuration 3d6. The hybridisation scheme is as shown in diagram. Six pairs of electrons, one from each NH molecule, occupy the six 3 hybrid orbitals. Thus, the complex has octahedral geometry and is diamagnetic because of the absence of unpaired electron. In the formation of this complex, since the inner d orbital(3d) is used in hybridisation, the complex,[Co(NH)] 3 + is called an inner orbital or low spin or spin 3 6 paired complex. The paramagnetic octahedral complex,[Cof] 3 uses 6 outer orbital(4d) in hybridisation(sp3d2). It is thus called outer orbital or high spin or spin free complex. Thus: Orbitals of Co3 + ion 3d 4s 4p 4d sp3d2hybridised orbitals of Co3 + 3d sp3d3 hybrid[Cof] 3 6(outer orbital or high spin complex) 3d Six pairs of electrons from six F ions In tetrahedral complexes one s and three p orbitals are hybridised to form four equivalent orbitals oriented tetrahedrally. This is ill - ustrated below for[Nicl] 2 -. 4 Here nickel is in + 2 oxidation state and the ion has the electronic configuration 3d8. The hybridisation scheme is as shown in diagram. Each Cl ion donates a pair of electrons. The compound is paramagnetic since it contains two unpaired electrons. Similarly,[Ni(CO)] has tetrahedral geometry but is diamagnetic since nickel is in 4 zero oxidation state and contains no unpaired electron. 129 Coordination Compounds Reprint 2025 - 26 In the square planar complexes, the hybridisation involved is dsp2. An example is[Ni(CN)] 2. Here nickel is in + 2 oxidation state and has 4 the electronic configuration 3d8. The hybridisation scheme is as shown in diagram: Orbitals of Ni2 + ion 3d 4s 4p dsp2hybridised orbitals of Ni2 + 3d dsp2 hydrid 4p[Ni(CN)] 2 4(low spin complex) 3d Four pairs of electrons 4p from 4 CN groups Each of the hybridised orbitals receives a pair of electrons from a cyanide ion. The compound is diamagnetic as evident from the absence of unpaired electron. It is important to note that the hybrid orbitals do not actually exist. In fact, hybridisation is a mathematical manipulation of wave equation for the atomic orbitals involved. 5. 5. 2 Magnetic The magnetic moment of coordination compounds can be measured Properties by the magnetic susceptibility experiments. The results can be used to of obtain information about the number of unpaired electrons and hence Coordination structures adopted by metal complexes. Compounds A critical study of the magnetic data of coordination compounds of metals of the first transition series reveals some complications. For metal ions with upto three electrons in the d orbitals, like Ti3 +(d1); V3 +(d2); Cr3 +(d3); two vacant d orbitals are available for octahedral hybridisation with 4s and 4p orbitals. The magnetic behaviour of these free ions and their coordination entities is similar. When more than three 3d electrons are present, the required pair of 3d orbitals for octahedral hybridisation is not directly available(as a consequence of Hund s rule). Thus, for d4(Cr2 +, Mn3 +), d5(Mn2 +, Fe3 +), d6(Fe2 +, Co3 +) cases, a vacant pair of d orbitals results only by pairing of 3d electrons which leaves two, one and zero unpaired electrons, respectively. The magnetic data agree with maximum spin pairing in many cases, especially with coordination compounds containing d6 ions. However, with species containing d4 and d5 ions there are complications.[Mn(CN)] 3 6 has magnetic moment of two unpaired electrons while[Mncl] 3 has a 6 paramagnetic moment of four unpaired electrons.[Fe(CN)] 3 has magnetic 6 moment of a single unpaired electron while[Fef] 3 has a paramagnetic 6 moment of five unpaired electrons.[Cof] 3 is paramagnetic with four 6 unpaired electrons while[Co(C O)] 3 is diamagnetic. This apparent 2 43 anomaly is explained by valence bond theory in terms of formation of inner orbital and outer orbital coordination entities.[Mn(CN)] 3,[Fe(CN)] 3 6 6 and[Co(C O)] 3 are inner orbital complexes involving d2sp3 hybridisation, 2 43 the former two complexes are paramagnetic and the latter diamagnetic. On the other hand,[Mncl] 3,[Fef] 3 and[Cof] 3 are outer orbital 6 6 6 - complexes involving sp3d2 hybridisation and are paramagnetic corresponding to four, five and four unpaired electrons. Chemistry 130 Reprint 2025 - 26 Example 55555. 77777 The spin only magnetic moment of[Mnbr] 2 is 5. 9 BM. Predict the 4 geometry of the complex ion? Solution Since the coordination number of Mn2 + ion in the complex ion is 4, it will be either tetrahedral(sp3 hybridisation) or square planar(dsp2 hybridisation). But the fact that the magnetic moment of the complex ion is 5. 9 BM, it should be tetrahedral in shape rather than square planar because of the presence of five unpaired electrons in the d orbitals. 5. 5. 3 Limitations While the VB theory, to a larger extent, explains the formation, structures of Valence and magnetic behaviour of coordination compounds, it suffers from Bond the following shortcomings: Theory(i) It involves a number of assumptions.(ii) It does not give quantitative interpretation of magnetic data.(i) It does not explain the colour exhibited by coordination compounds.(iv) It does not give a quantitative interpretation of the thermodynamic or kinetic stabilities of coordination compounds.(v) It does not make exact predictions regarding the tetrahedral and square planar structures of 4 - coordinate complexes.(vi) It does not distinguish between weak and strong ligands. 5. 5. 4 Crystal The crystal field theory(CFT) is an electrostatic model which considers Field the metal - ligand bond to be ionic arising purely from electrostatic Theory interactions between the metal ion and the ligand. Ligands are treated as point charges in case of anions or point dipoles in case of neutral molecules. The five d orbitals in an isolated gaseous metal atom / ion have same energy, i. e., they are degenerate. This degeneracy is maintained if a spherically symmetrical field of negative charges surrounds the metal atom / ion. However, when this negative field is due to ligands(either anions or the negative ends of dipolar molecules like NH and H O) in a complex, it becomes asymmetrical and the 3 2 degeneracy of the d orbitals is lifted. It results in splitting of the d orbitals. The pattern of splitting depends upon the nature of the crystal field. Let us explain this splitting in different crystal fields.(a) Crystal field splitting in octahedral coordination entities In an octahedral coordination entity with six ligands surrounding the metal atom / ion, there will be repulsion between the electrons in metal d orbitals and the electrons(or negative charges) of the ligands. Such a repulsion is more when the metal d orbital is directed towards the ligand than when it is away from the ligand. Thus, the d x2 y2 andd orbitals which point towards the axes along the direction of z2 the ligand will experience more repulsion and will be raised in energy; and the d, d and d orbitals which are directed between xy yz xz the axes will be lowered in energy relative to the average energy in the spherical crystal field. Thus, the degeneracy of the d orbitals has been removed due to ligand electron - metal electron repulsions in the octahedral complex to yield three orbitals of lower energy, t 2g set and two orbitals of higher energy, e set. This splitting of the g 131 Coordination Compounds Reprint 2025 - 26 degenerate levels due to the presence of ligands in a definite geometry is termed as crystal field splitting and the energy separation is denoted by D(the subscript o o is for octahedral)(Fig. 5. 8). Thus, the energy of the two e g orbitals will increase by(3 / 5) D and that of the three t will o 2g decrease by(2 / 5) D. O The crystal field splitting, D, depends upon the field o produced by the ligand and charge on the metal ion. Some ligands are able to produce strong fields in which case, the splitting will be large whereas others produce weak fields Fig. 5. 8: d orbital splitting in an octahedral crystal field and consequently result in small splitting of d orbitals. In general, ligands can be arranged in a series in the order of increasing field strength as given below: I < Br < SCN < Cl < S2 < F < OH < C O 2 < H O < NCS 2 4 2 < edta4 < NH < en < CN < CO 3 Such a series is termed as spectrochemical series. It is an experimentally determined series based on the absorption of light by complexes with different ligands. Let us assign electrons in the d orbitals of metal ion in octahedral coordination entities. Obviously, the single d electron occupies one of the lower energy t orbitals. In 2g d2 and d3 coordination entities, the d electrons occupy the t orbitals 2g singly in accordance with the Hund s rule. For d4 ions, two possible patterns of electron distribution arise:(i) the fourth electron could either enter the t level and pair with an existing electron, or(ii) it 2g could avoid paying the price of the pairing energy by occupying the e level. Which of these possibilities occurs, depends on the relative g magnitude of the crystal field splitting, D and the pairing energy, P o(P represents the energy required for electron pairing in a single orbital). The two options are:(i) If D < P, the fourth electron enters one of the e orbitals giving the o g configuration t3 e1. Ligands for which D < P are known as weak 2g g o field ligands and form high spin complexes.(ii) If D > P, it becomes more energetically favourable for the fourth o electron to occupy a t orbital with configuration t 4e 0. Ligands 2g 2g g which produce this effect are known as strong field ligands and form low spin complexes. Calculations show that d4 to d7 coordination entities are more stable for strong field as compared to weak field cases. Chemistry 132 Reprint 2025 - 26(b) Crystal field splitting in tetrahedral coordination entities In tetrahedral coordination entity formation, the d orbital splitting(Fig. 5. 9) is inverted and is smaller as compared to the octahedral field splitting. For the same metal, the same ligands and metal - ligand distances, it can be shown that D =(4 / 9) D. Consequently, t 0 the orbital splitting energies are not sufficiently large for forcing pairing and, therefore, low spin configurations are rarely observed. The g subscript is used for the octahedral and square planar complexes which have centre of symmetry. Since Fig. 5. 9: d orbital splitting in a tetrahedral tetrahedral complexes lack symmetry, g crystal field. Subscript is not used with energy levels. 5. 5. 5 Colour in In the previous Unit, we learnt that one of the most distinctive Coordination properties of transition metal complexes is their wide range of colours. Compounds This means that some of the visible spectrum is being removed from white light as it passes through the sample, so the light that emerges is no longer white. The colour of the complex is complementary to that which is absorbed. The complementary colour is the colour generated from the wavelength left over; if green light is absorbed by the complex, it appears red. Table 5. 3 gives the relationship of the different wavelength absorbed and the colour observed. Table 5. 3: Relationship between the Wavelength of Light absorbed and the Colour observed in some Coordination Entities Coordinaton Wavelength of light Colour of light Colour of coordination entity absorbed(nm) absorbed entity[Cocl(NH)] 2 + 535 Yellow Violet 3 5[Co(NH)(H O)] 3 + 500 Blue Green Red 35 2[Co(NH)] 3 + 475 Blue Yellow Orange 36[Co(CN)] 3 310 Ultraviolet Not in visible Pale Yellow 6 region[Cu(H O)] 2 + 600 Red Blue 2 4[Ti(H O)] 3 + 498 Blue Green Violet 2 6 The colour in the coordination compounds can be readily explained in terms of the crystal field theory. Consider, for example, the complex[Ti(H O)] 3 +, which is violet in colour. This is an octahedral complex 2 6 where the single electron(Ti3 + is a 3d1 system) in the metal d orbital is in the t level in the ground state of the complex. The next higher state 2g available for the electron is the empty e level. If light corresponding to g the energy of blue - green region is absorbed by the complex, it would excite the electron from t level to the e level(t 1e 0 fi t 0e 1). 2g g 2g g 2g g Consequently, the complex appears violet in colour(Fig. 5. 10). The crystal field theory attributes the colour of the coordination compounds to d - d transition of the electron. 133 Coordination Compounds Reprint 2025 - 26 It is important to note that in the absence of ligand, crystal field splitting does not occur and hence the substance is colourless. For example, removal of water from[Ti(H O)] Cl on heating 2 6 3 renders it colourless. Similarly, anhydrous CuSO 4 is white, but CuSO. 5H O is 4 2 Fig. 5. 10: Transition of an electron in blue in colour. The influence of the ligand on the colour of a complex may be illustrated by considering the[Ni(H O)] 2 + complex, 2 6 which forms when nickel(II) chloride is dissolved in water. If the didentate ligand, ethane - 1, 2 - diamine(en) is progressively added in the molar ratios en: Ni, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, the following series of reactions and their associated colour changes occur:[Ni(H O)] 2 +(aq) + en(aq) =[Ni(H O)(en)] 2 +(aq) + 2H O 2 6 2 4 2 green pale blue[Ni(H O)(en)] 2 +(aq) + en(aq) =[Ni(H O)(en)] 2 +(aq) + 2H O 2 4 2 2 2 2 blue / purple[Ni(H O)(en)] 2 +(aq) + en(aq) =[Ni(en)] 2 +(aq) + 2H O 2 2 2 3 2 violet This sequence is shown in Fig. 5. 11.

Ruby[Fig. 5. 12(a)] is aluminium oxide(Al O) containing about 0. 5 - 1 % Cr3 + ions(d3), which are 2 3 randomly distributed in positions normally occupied by Al3 +. We may view these chromium(I) species as octahedral chromium(I) complexes incorporated into the alumina lattice; d d transitions at these centres give rise to the colour.

The absorption 3 2 6 18 bands seen in the ruby shift(a)(b) to longer wavelength, namely yellow - red and blue, causing Fig. 5. 12:(a) Ruby: this gemstone was found in marble from Mogok, Myanmar;(b) emerald to transmit light in Emerald: this gemstone was found in the green region. Muzo, Columbia. 5. 5. 6 Limitations The crystal field model is successful in explaining the formation, of Crystal structures, colour and magnetic properties of coordination compounds Field to a large extent. However, from the assumptions that the ligands are Theory point charges, it follows that anionic ligands should exert the greatest splitting effect. The anionic ligands actually are found at the low end of the spectrochemical series. Further, it does not take into account the covalent character of bonding between the ligand and the central atom. These are some of the weaknesses of CFT, which are explained by ligand field theory(LFT) and molecular orbital theory which are beyond the scope of the present study.

These carbonyls have simple, well defined structures. Tetracarbonylnickel(0) is Carbonyls tetrahedral, pentacarbonyliron(0) is trigonalbipyramidal while hexacarbonyl chromium(0) is octahedral. Decacarbonyldimanganese(0) is made up of two square pyramidal Mn(CO) units joined by a Mn Mn bond. Octacarbonyldicobalt(0) 5 has a Co Co bond bridged by two CO groups(Fig. 5. 13). 135 Coordination Compounds Reprint 2025 - 26 CO CO OC Ni Fe CO OC CO OC CO CO O Ni(CO) Fe(CO) OC C CO 4 5 Tetrahedral Trigonal bipyramidal OC Co Co CO OC CO C CO CO CO CO CO CO CO O Fig. 5. 13 Cr OC Mn Mn CO[Co 2(CO) 8] Structures of some representative CO CO CO CO CO CO CO homoleptic metal carbonyls.

The M C s bond is formed by the donation of lone pair of electrons on the carbonyl carbon into a vacant orbital of the metal. The M C p bond is formed by the donation of a pair of electrons from a filled d orbital of metal into the vacant antibonding p * orbital of carbon monoxide. The metal to ligand bonding Fig. 5. 14: Example of synergic bonding creates a synergic effect which strengthens the interactions in a carbonyl bond between CO and the metal(Fig. 5. 14). Complex. 55555. 77777 Importance The coordination compounds are of great importance. These compounds and are widely present in the mineral, plant and animal worlds and are known to play many important functions in the area of analytical Aplications chemistry, metallurgy, biological systems, industry and medicine. These of are described below: Cordination Coordination compounds find use in many qualitative and quantitative chemical analysis. The familiar colour reactions given Compounds by metal ions with a number of ligands(especially chelating ligands), as a result of formation of coordination entities, form the basis for their detection and estimation by classical and instrumental methods of analysis. Examples of such reagents include EDTA, DMG(dimethylglyoxime), a nitroso b naphthol, cupron, etc. Hardness of water is estimated by simple titration with Na EDTA. 2 The Ca2 + and Mg2 + ions form stable complexes with EDTA. The selective estimation of these ions can be done due to difference in the stability constants of calcium and magnesium complexes. Some important extraction processes of metals, like those of silver and gold, make use of complex formation. Gold, for example, combines with cyanide in the presence of oxygen and water to form the coordination entity[Au(CN)] in aqueous solution. Gold can be separated in metallic 2 form from this solution by the addition of zinc. Similarly, purification of metals can be achieved through formation and subsequent decomposition of their coordination compounds. Chemistry 136 Reprint 2025 - 26 For example, impure nickel is converted to[Ni(CO)], which is 4 decomposed to yield pure nickel. Coordination compounds are of great importance in biological systems. The pigment responsible for photosynthesis, chlorophyll, is a coordination compound of magnesium. Haemoglobin, the red pigment of blood which acts as oxygen carrier is a coordination compound of iron. Vitamin B, cyanocobalamine, the anti 12 pernicious anaemia factor, is a coordination compound of cobalt. Among the other compounds of biological importance with coordinated metal ions are the enzymes like, carboxypeptidase A and carbonic anhydrase(catalysts of biological systems). Coordination compounds are used as catalysts for many industrial processes. Examples include rhodium complex,[(Ph P) Rhcl], a 3 3 Wilkinson catalyst, is used for the hydrogenation of alkenes. Articles can be electroplated with silver and gold much more smoothly and evenly from solutions of the complexes,[Ag(CN)] 2 and[Au(CN)] than from a solution of simple metal ions. 2 In black and white photography, the developed film is fixed by washing with hypo solution which dissolves the undecomposed Agbr to form a complex ion,[Ag(S O)] 3. 2 3 2 There is growing interest in the use of chelate therapy in medicinal chemistry. An example is the treatment of problems caused by the presence of metals in toxic proportions in plant / animal systems. Thus, excess of copper and iron are removed by the chelating ligands D penicillamine and desferrioxime B via the formation of coordination compounds. EDTA is used in the treatment of lead poisoning. Some coordination compounds of platinum effectively inhibit the growth of tumours. Examples are: cis platin and related compounds. Sumary The chemistry of coordination compounds is an important and challenging area of modern inorganic chemistry. During the last fifty years, advances in this area, have provided development of new concepts and models of bonding and molecular structure, novel breakthroughs in chemical industry and vital insights into the functioning of critical components of biological systems. The first systematic attempt at explaining the formation, reactions, structure and bonding of a coordination compound was made by A. Werner. His theory postulated the use of two types of linkages(primary and secondary) by a metal atom / ion in a coordination compound. In the modern language of chemistry these linkages are recognised as the ionisable(ionic) and non - ionisable(covalent) bonds, respectively. Using the property of isomerism, Werner predicted the geometrical shapes of a large number of coordination entities. The Valence Bond Theory(VBT) explains with reasonable success, the formation, magnetic behaviour and geometrical shapes of coordination compounds. It, however, fails to provide a quantitative interpretation of magnetic behaviour and has nothing to say about the optical properties of these compounds. The Crystal Field Theory(CFT) to coordination compounds is based on the effect of different crystal fields(provided by the ligands taken as point charges), 137 Coordination Compounds Reprint 2025 - 26 on the degeneracy of d orbital energies of the central metal atom / ion. The splitting of the d orbitals provides different electronic arrangements in strong and weak crystal fields. The treatment provides for quantitative estimations of orbital separation energies, magnetic moments and spectral and stability parameters. However, the assumption that ligands consititute point charges creates many theoretical difficulties. The metal carbon bond in metal carbonyls possesses both s and p character. The ligand to metal is s bond and metal to ligand is p bond. This unique synergic bonding provides stability to metal carbonyls. Coordination compounds are of great importance. These compounds provide critical insights into the functioning and structures of vital components of biological systems. Coordination compounds also find extensive applications in metallurgical processes, analytical and medicinal chemistry.

The hybridisation is d2sp3 forming inner orbital complex. In the presence of H O,(a weak ligand), 3d electrons do not pair up. The 2 hybridisation is sp3d2 forming an outer orbital complex containing five unpaired electrons, it is strongly paramagnetic. 5. 8 In the presence of NH, the 3d electrons pair up leaving two d orbitals empty 3 to be involved in d2sp3 hybridisation forming inner orbital complex in case of[Co(NH)] 3 +. 36 In Ni(NH) 2 +, Ni is in + 2 oxidation state and has d8 configuration, the 3 6 hybridisation involved is sp3d2 forming outer orbital complex. 5. 9 For square planar shape, the hybridisation is dsp2. Hence the unpaired electrons in 5d orbital pair up to make one d orbital empty for dsp2 hybridisation. Thus there is no unpaired electron. Chemistry 140 Reprint 2025 - 26"

For such calculations, logarithms are very useful. They help us in making difficult calculations\neasy. In Chemistry, logarithm values are required in solving problems of chemical kinetics, thermodynamics,\nelectrochemistry, etc. We shall first introduce this concept, and discuss the laws, which will have to be\nfollowed in working with logarithms, and then apply this technique to a number of problems to show\nhow it makes difficult calculations simple.\nWe know that\n23 = 8, 32 = 9, 53 = 125, 70 = 1\nIn general, for a positive real number a, and a rational number m, let am = b,\nwhere b is a real number. In other words\nthe mth power of base a is b.\nAnother way of stating the same fact is\nlogarithm of b to base a is m.\nIf for a positive real number a, a „ 1\nam = b,\nwe say that m is the logarithm of b to the base a.\nb\nWe write this as log  m,\na\n“log” being the abbreviation of the word “logarithm”.\nThus, we have\nlog 8 = 3, Since2 3 = 8\n2\nlog 9 = 2, Since3 2 = 9\n3\nlog 125 = 3, Since5 3 =125\n5\nlog 1= 0, Since7 0 =1\n7\nLaws of Logarithms\nIn the following discussion, we shall take logarithms to any base a, (a > 0 and a „ 1)\nFirst Law: log (mn) = log m + log n\na a a\nProof: Suppose that log m = x and log n = y\na a\nThen ax= m, ay = n\nHence mn = ax.ay = ax+y\nIt now follows from the definition of logarithms that\nlog (mn) = x + y = log m – log n\na a a\nm\nSecond Law: log  = log m – log n\na  n  a a\nProof: Let log m = x, log n = y\na a\n145 Appendix\nReprint 2025-26\nThen ax = m, ay = n\nx\nm a\nxy\nHence   a\ny\nn a\nTherefore\nm\nlog    x  y  log m  log n\na a a\n n \nThird Law : log (mn) = n log m\na a\nProof : As before, if log m = x, then ax = m\na\nn  xn nx\nThen m  a  a\ngiving log (mn) = nx = n log m\na a\nThus according to First Law: “the log of the product of two numbers is equal to the sum of their logs.\nSimilarly, the Second Law says: the log of the ratio of two numbers is the difference of their logs. Thus,\nthe use of these laws converts a problem of multiplication/division into a problem of addition/subtraction,\nwhich are far easier to perform than multiplication/division. That is why logarithms are so useful in\nall numerical computations.\nLogarithms to Base 10\nBecause number 10 is the base of writing numbers, it is very convenient to use logarithms to the base\n10. Some examples are:\nlog 10 = 1, since 101 = 10\n10\nlog 100 = 2, since 102 = 100\n10\nlog 10000 = 4, since 104 = 10000\n10\nlog 0.01 = –2, since 10–2 = 0.01\n10\nlog 0.001 = –3, since 10–3 = 0.001\n10\nand log 1 = 0 since 100 = 1\n10\nThe above results indicate that if n is an integral power of 10, i.e., 1 followed by several zeros or\n1 preceded by several zeros immediately to the right of the decimal point, then log n can be easily found.\nIf n is not an integral power of 10, then it is not easy to calculate log n. But mathematicians have\nmade tables from which we can read off approximate value of the logarithm of any positive number\nbetween 1 and 10. And these are sufficient for us to calculate the logarithm of any number expressed\nin decimal form. For this purpose, we always express the given decimal as the product of an integral\npower of 10 and a number between 1 and 10.\nStandard Form of Decimal\nWe can express any number in decimal form, as the product of (i) an integral power of 10, and (ii)\na number between 1 and 10. Here are some examples:\n(i) 25.2 lies between 10 and 100\n25.2\n1\n25.2 = 10  2.5210\n10\n(ii) 1038.4 lies between 1000 and 10000.\n1038.4\n3 3\n 1038.4   10  1.0384  10\n1000\n(iii) 0.005 lies between 0.001 and 0.01\n\\ 0.005 = (0.005 × 1000) × 10–3 = 5.0 × 10–3\n(iv) 0.00025 lies between 0.0001 and 0.001\n\\ 0.00025 = (0.00025 × 10000) × 10–4 = 2.5 × 10–4\nChemistry 146\nReprint 2025-26\nIn each case, we divide or multiply the decimal by a power of 10, to bring one non-zero digit to the left\nof the decimal point, and do the reverse operation by the same power of 10, indicated separately.\nThus, any positive decimal can be written in the form\nn = m × 10p\nwhere p is an integer (positive, zero or negative) and 1< m < 10. This is called the “standard form of n.”\nWorking Rule\n1. Move the decimal point to the left, or to the right, as may be necessary, to bring one non-zero digit\nto the left of decimal point.\n2. (i) If you move p places to the left, multiply by 10p.\n(ii) If you move p places to the right, multiply by 10–p.\n(iii) If you do not move the decimal point at all, multiply by 100.\n(iv) Write the new decimal obtained by the power of 10 (of step 2) to obtain the standard form of\nthe given decimal.\nCharacteristic and Mantissa\nConsider the standard form of n\nn = m ×10p, where 1 < m < 10\nTaking logarithms to the base 10 and using the laws of logarithms\nlog n = log m + log 10p\n= log m + p log 10\n= p + log m\nHere p is an integer and as 1 < m < 10, so 0 < log m < 1, i.e., m lies between 0 and 1. When log\nn has been expressed as p + log m, where p is an integer and 0 log m < 1, we say that p is the\n“characteristic” of log n and that log m is the “mantissa of log n. Note that characteristic is always an\ninteger – positive, negative or zero, and mantissa is never negative and is always less than 1. If we can\nfind the characteristics and the mantissa of log n, we have to just add them to get log n.\nThus to find log n, all we have to do is as follows:\n1. Put n in the standard form, say\nn = m × 10p, 1 < m <10\n2. Read off the characteristic p of log n from this expression (exponent of 10).\n3. Look up log m from tables, which is being explained below.\n4. Write log n = p + log m\nIf the characteristic p of a number n is say, 2 and the mantissa is .4133, then we have log n = 2\n+ .4133 which we can write as 2.4133. If, however, the characteristic p of a number m is say –2 and the\nmantissa is .4123, then we have log m = –2 + .4123. We cannot write this as –2.4123. (Why?) In order\nto avoid this confusion we write 2 for –2 and thus we write log m = 2.4123 .\nNow let us explain how to use the table of logarithms to find mantissas. A table is appended at the\nend of this Appendix.\nObserve that in the table, every row starts with a two digit number, 10, 11, 12,... 97, 98, 99. Every\ncolumn is headed by a one-digit number, 0, 1, 2, ...9. On the right, we have the section called “Mean\ndifferences” which has 9 columns headed by 1, 2...9.\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..\n61 7853 7860 7868 7875 7882 7889 7896 7803 7810 7817 1 1 2 3 4 4 5 6 6\n62 7924 7931 7935 7945 7954 7959 7966 7973 7980 7987 1 1 2 3 3 4 5 6 6\n63 7993 8000 8007 8014 8021 8028 8035 8041 8048 8055 1 1 2 3 3 4 5 6 6\n.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..\n147 Appendix\nReprint 2025-26\nNow suppose we wish to find log (6.234). Then look into the row starting with 62. In this row, look\nat the number in the column headed by 3. The number is 7945. This means that\nlog (6.230) = 0.7945*\nBut we want log (6.234). So our answer will be a little more than 0.7945. How much more? We look\nthis up in the section on Mean differences. Since our fourth digit is 4, look under the column headed\nby 4 in the Mean difference section (in the row 62). We see the number 3 there. So add 3 to 7945. We\nget 7948. So we finally have\nlog (6.234) = 0.7948.\nTake another example. To find log (8.127), we look in the row 81 under column 2, and we find 9096.\nWe continue in the same row and see that the mean difference under 7 is 4. Adding this to 9096, and\nwe get 9100. So, log (8.127) = 0.9100.\nFinding N when log N is given\nWe have so far discussed the procedure for finding log n when a positive number n given. We now turn\nto its converse i.e., to find n when log n is given and give a method for this purpose. If log n = t, we\nsometimes say n = antilog t. Therefore our task is given t, find its antilog. For this, we use the ready-\nmade antilog tables.\nSuppose log n = 2.5372.\nTo find n, first take just the mantissa of log n. In this case it is .5372. (Make sure it is positive.)\nNow take up antilog of this number in the antilog table which is to be used exactly like the log table.\nIn the antilog table, the entry under column 7 in the row .53 is 3443 and the mean difference for the\nlast digit 2 in that row is 2, so the table gives 3445. Hence,\nantilog (.5372) = 3.445\nNow since log n = 2.5372, the characteristic of log n is 2. So the standard form of n is given by\nn = 3.445 × 102\nor n = 344.5\nIllustration 1:\nIf log x = 1.0712, find x.\nSolution: We find that the number corresponding to 0712 is 1179. Since characteristic of log x is 1, we\nhave\nx = 1.179 × 101\n= 11.79\nIllustration 2:\nIf log x = 2.1352, find x.\n10\nSolution: From antilog tables, we find that the number corresponding to 1352 is 1366. Since the\ncharacteristic is 2 i.e., –2, so\nx = 1.366 × 10–2 = 0.01366\nUse of Logarithms in Numerical Calculations\nIllustration 1:\nFind 6.3 × 1.29\nSolution: Let x = 6.3 × 1.29\nThen log x = log (6.3 × 1.29) = log 6.3 + log 1.29\n10\nNow,\nlog 6.3 = 0.7993\nlog 1.29 = 0.1106\n\\ log x = 0.9099,\n10\n* It should, however, be noted that the values given in the table are not exact. They are only approximate values,\nalthough we use the sign of equality which may give the impression that they are exact values. The same\nconvention will be followed in respect of antilogarithm of a number.\nChemistry 148\nReprint 2025-26\nTaking antilog\nx = 8.127\nIllustration

For such calculations, logarithms are very useful. They help us in making difficult calculations easy. In Chemistry, logarithm values are required in solving problems of chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, electrochemistry, etc. We shall first introduce this concept, and discuss the laws, which will have to be followed in working with logarithms, and then apply this technique to a number of problems to show how it makes difficult calculations simple. We know that 23 = 8, 32 = 9, 53 = 125, 70 = 1 In general, for a positive real number a, and a rational number m, let am = b, where b is a real number. In other words the mth power of base a is b. Another way of stating the same fact is logarithm of b to base a is m. If for a positive real number a, a 1 am = b, we say that m is the logarithm of b to the base a. B We write this as log m, a log being the abbreviation of the word logarithm. Thus, we have log 8 = 3, Since2 3 = 8 2 log 9 = 2, Since3 2 = 9 3 log 125 = 3, Since5 3 = 125 5 log 1 = 0, Since7 0 = 1 7 Laws of Logarithms In the following discussion, we shall take logarithms to any base a,(a > 0 and a 1) First Law: log(mn) = log m + log n a a a Proof: Suppose that log m = x and log n = y a a Then ax = m, ay = n Hence mn = ax. ay = ax + y It now follows from the definition of logarithms that log(mn) = x + y = log m log n a a a m Second Law: log = log m log n a n a a Proof: Let log m = x, log n = y a a 145 Appendix Reprint 2025 - 26 Then ax = m, ay = n x m a x y Hence a y n a Therefore m log x y log m log n a a a n Third Law: log(mn) = n log m a a Proof: As before, if log m = x, then ax = m a n x n nx Then m a a giving log(mn) = nx = n log m a a Thus according to First Law: the log of the product of two numbers is equal to the sum of their logs. Similarly, the Second Law says: the log of the ratio of two numbers is the difference of their logs. Thus, the use of these laws converts a problem of multiplication / division into a problem of addition / subtraction, which are far easier to perform than multiplication / division. That is why logarithms are so useful in all numerical computations. Logarithms to Base 10 Because number 10 is the base of writing numbers, it is very convenient to use logarithms to the base 10. Some examples are: log 10 = 1, since 101 = 10 10 log 100 = 2, since 102 = 100 10 log 10000 = 4, since 104 = 10000 10 log 0. 01 = 2, since 10 2 = 0. 01 10 log 0. 001 = 3, since 10 3 = 0. 001 10 and log 1 = 0 since 100 = 1 10 The above results indicate that if n is an integral power of 10, i. e., 1 followed by several zeros or 1 preceded by several zeros immediately to the right of the decimal point, then log n can be easily found. If n is not an integral power of 10, then it is not easy to calculate log n. But mathematicians have made tables from which we can read off approximate value of the logarithm of any positive number between 1 and 10. And these are sufficient for us to calculate the logarithm of any number expressed in decimal form. For this purpose, we always express the given decimal as the product of an integral power of 10 and a number between 1 and 10. Standard Form of Decimal We can express any number in decimal form, as the product of(i) an integral power of 10, and(ii) a number between 1 and 10. Here are some examples:(i) 25. 2 lies between 10 and 100 25. 2 1 25. 2 = 10 2. 52 10 10(ii) 1038. 4 lies between 1000 and 10000. 1038. 4 3 3 1038. 4 10 1. 0384 10 1000(i) 0. 005 lies between 0. 001 and 0. 01 \\ 0. 005 =(0. 005 × 1000) × 10 3 = 5. 0 × 10 3(iv) 0. 00025 lies between 0. 0001 and 0. 001 \\ 0. 00025 =(0. 00025 × 10000) × 10 4 = 2. 5 × 10 4 Chemistry 146 Reprint 2025 - 26 In each case, we divide or multiply the decimal by a power of 10, to bring one non - zero digit to the left of the decimal point, and do the reverse operation by the same power of 10, indicated separately. Thus, any positive decimal can be written in the form n = m × 10p where p is an integer(positive, zero or negative) and 1 < m < 10. This is called the standard form of n. Working Rule 1. Move the decimal point to the left, or to the right, as may be necessary, to bring one non - zero digit to the left of decimal point. 2.(i) If you move p places to the left, multiply by 10p.(ii) If you move p places to the right, multiply by 10 p.(i) If you do not move the decimal point at all, multiply by 100.(iv) Write the new decimal obtained by the power of 10(of step 2) to obtain the standard form of the given decimal. Characteristic and Mantissa Consider the standard form of n n = m × 10p, where 1 < m < 10 Taking logarithms to the base 10 and using the laws of logarithms log n = log m + log 10p = log m + p log 10 = p + log m Here p is an integer and as 1 < m < 10, so 0 < log m < 1, i. e., m lies between 0 and 1. When log n has been expressed as p + log m, where p is an integer and 0 log m < 1, we say that p is the characteristic of log n and that log m is the mantissa of log n. Note that characteristic is always an integer positive, negative or zero, and mantissa is never negative and is always less than 1. If we can find the characteristics and the mantissa of log n, we have to just add them to get log n. Thus to find log n, all we have to do is as follows: 1. Put n in the standard form, say n = m × 10p, 1 < m < 10 2. Read off the characteristic p of log n from this expression(exponent of 10). 3. Look up log m from tables, which is being explained below. 4. Write log n = p + log m If the characteristic p of a number n is say, 2 and the mantissa is. 4133, then we have log n = 2 +. 4133 which we can write as 2. 4133. If, however, the characteristic p of a number m is say 2 and the mantissa is. 4123, then we have log m = 2 +. 4123. We cannot write this as 2. 4123.(Why?) In order to avoid this confusion we write 2 for 2 and thus we write log m = 2. 4123. Now let us explain how to use the table of logarithms to find mantissas. A table is appended at the end of this Appendix. Observe that in the table, every row starts with a two digit number, 10, 11, 12,. 97, 98, 99. Every column is headed by a one - digit number, 0, 1, 2,. 9. On the right, we have the section called Mean differences which has 9 columns headed by 1, 2. 9. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.................... 61 7853 7860 7868 7875 7882 7889 7896 7803 7810 7817 1 1 2 3 4 4 5 6 6 62 7924 7931 7935 7945 7954 7959 7966 7973 7980 7987 1 1 2 3 3 4 5 6 6 63 7993 8000 8007 8014 8021 8028 8035 8041 8048 8055 1 1 2 3 3 4 5 6 6.................... 147 Appendix Reprint 2025 - 26 Now suppose we wish to find log(6. 234). Then look into the row starting with 62. In this row, look at the number in the column headed by 3. The number is 7945. This means that log(6. 230) = 0. 7945 * But we want log(6. 234). So our answer will be a little more than 0. 7945. How much more? We look this up in the section on Mean differences. Since our fourth digit is 4, look under the column headed by 4 in the Mean difference section(in the row 62). We see the number 3 there. So add 3 to 7945. We get 7948. So we finally have log(6. 234) = 0. 7948. Take another example. To find log(8. 127), we look in the row 81 under column 2, and we find 9096. We continue in the same row and see that the mean difference under 7 is 4. Adding this to 9096, and we get 9100. So, log(8. 127) = 0. 9100. Finding N when log N is given We have so far discussed the procedure for finding log n when a positive number n given. We now turn to its converse i. e., to find n when log n is given and give a method for this purpose. If log n = t, we sometimes say n = antilog t. Therefore our task is given t, find its antilog. For this, we use the ready - made antilog tables. Suppose log n = 2. 5372. To find n, first take just the mantissa of log n. In this case it is. 5372.(Make sure it is positive.) Now take up antilog of this number in the antilog table which is to be used exactly like the log table. In the antilog table, the entry under column 7 in the row. 53 is 3443 and the mean difference for the last digit 2 in that row is 2, so the table gives 3445. Hence, antilog(. 5372) = 3. 445 Now since log n = 2. 5372, the characteristic of log n is 2. So the standard form of n is given by n = 3. 445 × 102 or n = 344. 5 Illustration 1: If log x = 1. 0712, find x. Solution: We find that the number corresponding to 0712 is 1179. Since characteristic of log x is 1, we have x = 1. 179 × 101 = 11. 79 Illustration 2: If log x = 2. 1352, find x. 10 Solution: From antilog tables, we find that the number corresponding to 1352 is 1366. Since the characteristic is 2 i. e., 2, so x = 1. 366 × 10 2 = 0. 01366 Use of Logarithms in Numerical Calculations Illustration 1: Find 6. 3 × 1. 29 Solution: Let x = 6. 3 × 1. 29 Then log x = log(6. 3 × 1. 29) = log 6. 3 + log 1. 29 10 Now, log 6. 3 = 0. 7993 log 1. 29 = 0. 1106 \\ log x = 0. 9099, 10 * It should, however, be noted that the values given in the table are not exact. They are only approximate values, although we use the sign of equality which may give the impression that they are exact values.

The order of reactivity of alcohols\nwith a given haloacid is 3°>2°>1°. Phosphorus tribromide and triiodide\nare usually generated in situ (produced in the reaction mixture) by the\nreaction of red phosphorus with bromine and iodine respectively.\nThe preparation of alkyl chloride is carried out either by passing\ndry hydrogen chloride gas through a solution of alcohol or by heating\na mixture of alcohol and concentrated aqueous halogen acid.\nThe above methods are not applicable for the preparation of aryl\nhalides because the carbon-oxygen bond in phenols has a partial double\nbond character and is difficult to break being stronger than a single\nbond.\n6.4.2 From (I) From alkanes by free radical halogenation\nHydrocarbons Free radical chlorination or bromination of alkanes gives a complex\nmixture of isomeric mono- and polyhaloalkanes, which is difficult to\nChemistry 164\nReprint 2025-26\nseparate as pure compounds.

Higher members\nare liquids or solids. As we have already learnt, molecules of organic\nhalogen compounds are generally polar. Due to greater polarity as well\nas higher molecular mass as compared to the parent hydrocarbon, the\nintermolecular forces of attraction (dipole-dipole and van der Waals)\nare stronger in the halogen derivatives. That is why the boiling points\nof chlorides, bromides and iodides are considerably higher than those\nof the hydrocarbons of comparable molecular mass.\nThe attractions get stronger as the molecules get bigger in size and\nhave more electrons. The pattern of variation of boiling points of different\nhalides is depicted in Fig. 6.1. For the same alkyl group, the boiling\npoints of alkyl halides decrease in the order: RI> RBr> RCl> RF. This\nis because with the increase in size and mass of halogen atom, the\nmagnitude of van der Waal forces increases.\nFig. 6.1: Comparison of boiling points of some alkyl halides\nThe boiling points of isomeric haloalkanes decrease with increase\nin branching. For example, 2-bromo-2-methylpropane has the lowest\nboiling point among the three isomers.\nBoiling points of isomeric dihalobenzenes are very nearly the same.\nHowever, the para-isomers are high melting as compared to their ortho-\nand meta-isomers. It is due to symmetry of para-isomers that fits in\ncrystal lattice better as compared to ortho- and meta-isomers.\nChemistry 168\nReprint 2025-26\nDensity\nBromo, iodo and polychloro derivatives of hydrocarbons are heavier than\nwater.

In order to dissolve\nhaloalkane in water, energy is required to overcome the attractions between\nthe haloalkane molecules and break the hydrogen bonds between water\nmolecules. Less energy is released when new attractions are set up between\nthe haloalkane and the water molecules as these are not as strong as the\noriginal hydrogen bonds in water. As a result, the solubility of haloalkanes\nin water is low. However, haloalkanes tend to dissolve in organic solvents\nbecause the new intermolecular attractions between haloalkanes and\nsolvent molecules have much the same strength as the ones being broken\nin the separate haloalkane and solvent molecules.\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\n6.6 Arrange each set of compounds in order of increasing boiling points.\n(i) Bromomethane, Bromoform, Chloromethane, Dibromomethane.\n(ii) 1-Chloropropane, Isopropyl chloride, 1-Chlorobutane.\n66666.....77777 CCCCChhhhheeeeemmmmmiiiiicccccaaaaalllll The reactions of haloalkanes may be divided into the following categories:\nRRRRReeeeeaaaaaccccctttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss 1.

The reaction in which a nucleophile replaces\n169 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\nalready existing nucleophile in a molecule is called nucleophilic\nsubstitution reaction. Haloalkanes are substrate in these reactions.\nIn this type of reaction, a nucleophile reacts with haloalkane (the\nsubstrate) having a partial positive charge on the carbon atom bonded\nto halogen. A substitution reaction takes place and halogen atom,\ncalled leaving group departs as halide ion. Since the substitution\nreaction is initiated by a nucleophile, it is called nucleophilic\nsubstitution reaction.\nIt is one of the most useful classes of organic reactions of alkyl\nhalides in which halogen is bonded to sp3 hybridised carbon.

Similarly nitrite ion also represents an ambident\nii\nnucleophile with two different points of linkage [–O—N=O]. The linkage\nthrough oxygen results in alkyl nitrites while through nitrogen atom, it\nleads to nitroalkanes.\nMechanism: This reaction has been found to proceed by two different\nmechanims which are described below:\n(a) Substitution nucleophilic bimolecular (S 2)\nN\nThe reaction between CH Cl and hydroxide ion to yield methanol and\n3\nchloride ion follows a second order kinetics, i.e., the rate depends\nupon the concentration of both the reactants.\nThe solid wedge represents the bond coming out of the paper, dashed line going down the\npaper and a straight line representing bond in the plane of the paper.\nThe above reaction can be represented diagrammatically as shown in\nFig. 6.2.\nFig. 6.2: Red ball represents the incoming hydroxide ion and green ball represents\nthe outgoing halide ion\nIn the year 1937, It depicts a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (S 2) reaction;\nN\nEdward Davies Hughes the incoming nucleophile interacts with alkyl halide causing the\nand Sir Christopher\ncarbon-halide bond to break and a new bond is formed between\nIngold proposed a\ncarbon and attacking nucleophile. Here it is C-O bond formed between\nmechanism for an S 2\nreaction. N C and -OH. These two processes take place simultaneously in a\n171 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\nsingle step and no intermediate is formed. As the reaction progresses\nand the bond between the incoming nucleophile and the carbon\natom starts forming, the bond between carbon atom and leaving\ngroup weakens. As this happens, the three carbon-hydrogen bonds\nof the substrate start moving away from the attacking nucleophile. In\ntransition state all the three C-H bonds are in the same plane and the\nattacking and leaving nucleophiles are partially attached to the\ncarbon. As the attacking nucleophile approaches closer to the carbon,\nC-H bonds still keep on moving in the same direction till the attacking\nnucleophile attaches to carbon and leaving group leaves the carbon.\nAs a result configuration is inverted, the configuration (See box) of\ncarbon atom under attack inverts in much the same way as an\numbrella is turned inside out when caught in a strong wind. This\nprocess is called as inversion of configuration. In the transition\nstate, the carbon atom is simultaneously bonded to incoming\nnucleophile and the outgoing leaving group. Such structures are\nunstable and cannot be isolated. Thus, in the transition state, carbon\nis simultaneously bonded to five atoms.\nConfiguration\nSpacial arrangement of functional groups around carbon is called its configuration.\nSee the structures (A) and (B) given below carefully.\nThese are the two structures of the same compound. They differ in spacial arrangement\nof functional groups attached to carbon. Structure (A) is mirror image of Structure (B).\nWe say configuration of carbon in structure (A) is mirror image of the configuration of\ncarbon in structure (B).\nHughes worked under Since this reaction requires the approach of the nucleophile to the\nIngold and earned a carbon bearing the leaving group, the presence of bulky substituents\nD.Sc. degree from the\non or near the carbon atom have a dramatic inhibiting effect. Of the\nUniversity of London.\nsimple alkyl halides, methyl halides react most rapidly in S 2 reactions\nN\nbecause there are only three small hydrogen atoms. Tertiary halides\nare the least reactive because bulky groups hinder the approaching\nChemistry 172\nReprint 2025-26\nnucleophiles. Thus the order of reactivity followed is:\nPrimary halide > Secondary halide > Tertiary halide.\nFig.6.3: Steric effects in S 2 reaction. The relative rate of S 2 reaction is given in parenthesis\nN N\n(b) Substitution nucleophilic unimolecular (S 1)\nN\nS 1 reactions are generally carried out in polar protic solvents\nN\n(like water, alcohol, acetic acid, etc.). The reaction between tert-\nbutyl bromide and hydroxide ion yields tert-butyl alcohol and\nfollows the first order kinetics, i.e., the rate of reaction depends\nupon the concentration of only one reactant, which is tert- butyl\nbromide.\nIt occurs in two steps. In step I, the polarised C—Br bond undergoes\nslow cleavage to produce a carbocation and a bromide ion. The\ncarbocation thus formed is then attacked by nucleophile in step II\nto complete the substitution reaction.\n173 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\nStep I is the slowest and reversible. It involves the C–Br bond breaking for which the\nenergy is obtained through solvation of halide ion with the proton of protic solvent. Since\nthe rate of reaction depends upon the slowest step, the rate of reaction depends only on the\nconcentration of alkyl halide and not on the concentration of hydroxide ion. Further, greater\nthe stability of carbocation, greater will be its ease of formation from alkyl halide and faster\nwill be the rate of reaction. In case of alkyl halides, 30 alkyl halides undergo S 1 reaction\nN\nvery fast because of the high stability of 30 carbocations. We can sum up the order of reactivity\nof alkyl halides towards S 1 and S 2 reactions as follows:\nN N\nFor the same reasons, allylic and benzylic halides show high reactivity towards the S 1\nN\nreaction.

Such (+) and (–) isomers of a compound are called\noptical isomers and the phenomenon is termed as optical\nisomerism.\n(ii) Molecular asymmetry, chirality and enantiomers: The\nobservation of Louis Pasteur (1848) that crystals of certain\ncompounds exist in the form of mirror images laid the\nfoundation of modern stereochemistry. He demonstrated that\naqueous solutions of both types of crystals showed optical\nrotation, equal in magnitude (for solution of equal concentration)\nbut opposite in direction. He believed that this difference in\noptical activity was associated with the three dimensional\narrangements of atoms in the molecules (configurations) of\n175 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\ntwo types of crystals. Dutch scientist, J. Van’t Hoff and French\nscientist, C. Le Bel in the same year (1874), independently\nargued that the spatial arrangement of four groups (valencies)\nJacobus Hendricus\naround a central carbon is tetrahedral and if all the substituents\nVan’t Hoff (1852-1911)\nattached to that carbon are different, the mirror image of the\nreceived the first Nobel\nmolecule is not superimposed (overlapped) on the molecule;\nPrize in Chemistry in\n1901 for his work on such a carbon is called asymmetric carbon or stereocentre.\nsolutions. The resulting molecule would lack symmetry and is referred to\nas asymmetric molecule. The asymmetry of the molecule along\nwith non superimposability of mirror images is responsible for\nthe optical activity in such organic compounds.\nThe symmetry and asymmetry are also observed in many day to day\nobjects: a sphere, a cube, a cone, are all identical to\ntheir mirror images and can be superimposed.\nHowever, many objects are non superimposable on\ntheir mirror images. For example, your left and right\nhand look similar but if you put your left hand on\nyour right hand by moving them in the same plane,\nthey do not coincide. The objects which are non-\nsuperimposable on their mirror image (like a pair\nof hands) are said to be chiral and this property is\nknown as chirality. Chiral molecules are optically\nactive, while the objects, which are, superimposable\non their mirror images are called achiral. These\nmolecules are optically inactive.\nThe above test of molecular chirality can be\napplied to organic molecules by constructing\nmodels and its mirror images or by drawing three\ndimensional structures and attempting to\nsuperimpose them in our minds. There are other\naids, however, that can assist us in recognising\nchiral molecules. One such aid is the presence of\nFig 6.4: Some common examples of chiral and\na single asymmetric carbon atom. Let us consider\nachiral objects\ntwo simple molecules propan-2-ol (Fig.6.5) and butan-2-ol (Fig.6.6)\nand their mirror images.\nFig 6.5: B is mirror image of A; B is rotated by 180o and C is\nobtained; C is superimposable on A.\nAs you can see very clearly, propan-2-ol (A) does not contain an asymmetric\ncarbon, as all the four groups attached to the tetrahedral carbon are not\ndifferent. We rotate the mirror image (B) of the molecule by 180° (structure\nC) and try to overlap the structure (C) with the structure (A), these structures\ncompletely overlap. Thus propan-2-ol is an achiral molecule.\nChemistry 176\nReprint 2025-26\nFig 6.6: E is mirror image of D; E is rotated by 180o to get F and F is\nnon superimposable on its mirror image D.\nButan-2-ol has four different groups attached to\nthe tetrahedral carbon and as expected is chiral. Some common\nexamples of chiral molecules such as\n2-chlorobutane, 2, 3-dihyroxypropanal, (OHC–CHOH–CH OH),\n2\nbromochloro-iodomethane (BrClCHI),2-bromopropanoic acid\n(H C–CHBr–COOH), etc.\n3\nFig. 6.7: A chiral molecule The stereoisomers related to each other as non-\nand its mirror image superimposable mirror images are called enantiomers\n(Fig. 6.7). A and B in Fig. 6.5 and D and E in Fig. 6.6 are\nenantiomers.\nEnantiomers possess identical physical properties namely,\nmelting point, boiling point, refractive index, etc. They only differ\nwith respect to the rotation of plane polarised light. If one of the\nenantiomer is dextro rotatory, the other will be laevo rotatory.\nHowever, the sign of optical rotation is not necessarily related to\nthe absolute (actual) configuration of the molecule.\nA mixture containing two enantiomers in equal proportions\nwill have zero optical rotation, as the rotation due to one isomer\nwill be cancelled by the rotation due to the other isomer. Such\na mixture is known as racemic mixture or racemic\nmodification. A racemic mixture is represented by prefixing dl\nor (–) before the name, for example (–) butan-2-ol. The process\nof conversion of enantiomer into a racemic mixture is known as\nracemisation.\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 66666.....88888 Identify chiral and achiral molecules in each of the following pair of\ncompounds.

Such a reaction is said\nto proceed with retention of the configuration. Consider as an\nexample, the reaction that takes place when (–)-2-methylbutan-1-ol\nis heated with concentrated hydrochloric acid.\nIt is important to note that configuration at a symmetric centre in\nthe reactant and product is same but the sign of optical rotation\nhas changed in the product. This is so because two different\ncompounds with same configuration at asymmetric centre may have\ndifferent optical rotation. One may be dextrorotatory (plus sign of\noptical rotation) while other may be laevorotatory (negative sign of\noptical rotation).\n(iv) Inversion, retention and racemisation: There are three outcomes\nfor a reaction at an asymmetric carbon atom, when a bond directly\nlinked to an asymmetric carbon atom is broken. Consider the\nreplacement of a group X by Y in the following reaction;\nIf (A) is the only compound obtained, the process is called retention\nof configuration. Note that configuration has been rotated in A.\nIf (B) is the only compound obtained, the process is called inversion\nof configuration. Configuration has been inverted in B.\nChemistry 178\nReprint 2025-26\nIf a 50:50 mixture of A and B is obtained then the process is called\nracemisation and the product is optically inactive, as one isomer will\nrotate the plane polarised light in the direction opposite to another.\nNow let us have a fresh look at S 1 and S 2 mechanisms by\nN N\ntaking examples of optically active alkyl halides.\nIn case of optically active alkyl halides, the product formed as a\nresult of S 2 mechanism has the inverted configuration as compared\nN\nto the reactant. This is because the nucleophile attaches itself on the\nside opposite to the one where the halogen atom is present. When\n(–)-2-bromooctane is allowed to react with sodium hydroxide,\n(+)-octan-2-ol is formed with the –OH group occupying the position\nopposite to what bromide had occupied.\nThus, S 2 reactions of optically active halides are accompanied by\nN\ninversion of configuration.\nIn case of optically active alkyl halides, S 1 reactions are\nN\naccompanied by racemisation. Can you think of the reason why it\nhappens? Actually the carbocation formed in the slow step being sp2\nhybridised is planar (achiral). The attack of the nucleophile may be\naccomplished from either side of the plane of carbocation resulting in\na mixture of products, one having the same configuration (the –OH\nattaching on the same position as halide ion) and the other having\nLocation of aaaaa and opposite configuration (the –OH attaching on the side opposite to halide\nbbbbb carbon in a ion). This may be illustrated by hydrolysis of optically active\nmolecule 2-bromobutane, which results in the formation of (–)-butan-2-ol.\nCarbon on which 2. Elimination reactions\nhalogen atom is When a haloalkane with b-hydrogen atom is heated with alcoholic\ndirectly attached is solution of potassium hydroxide, there is elimination of hydrogen\ncalled a-carbon and atom from b-carbon and a halogen atom from the a-carbon atom.\nthe carbon atom\nadjacent to this\ncarbon is called\nb-carbon.\n179 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\nAs a result, an alkene is formed as a product. Since b-hydrogen\natom is involved in elimination, it is often called bbbbb-elimination.\nIf there is possibility of formation of more than one alkene due to\nthe availability of more than one b-hydrogen atoms, usually one alkene\nis formed as the major product. These form part of a pattern first\nobserved by Russian chemist, Alexander Zaitsev (also pronounced as\nSaytzeff) who in 1875 formulated a rule which can be summarised as\n“in dehydrohalogenation reactions, the preferred product is that\nalkene which has the greater number of alkyl groups attached to the\ndoubly bonded carbon atoms.” Thus, 2-bromopentane gives\npent-2-ene as the major product.\nEEEEEllllliiiiimmmmmiiiiinnnnnaaaaatttttiiiiiooooonnnnn vvvvveeeeerrrrrsssssuuuuusssss sssssuuuuubbbbbssssstttttiiiiitttttuuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\nA chemical reaction is the result of competition; it is a race that is won by the fastest\nrunner. A collection of molecules tend to do, by and large, what is easiest for them. An\nalkyl halide with b-hydrogen atoms when reacted with a base or a nucleophile has two\ncompeting routes: substitution (S 1 and S 2) and elimination. Which route will be taken\nN N\nup depends upon the nature of alkyl halide, strength and size of base/nucleophile and\nreaction conditions. Thus, a bulkier nucleophile will prefer to act as a base and abstracts\na proton rather than approach a tetravalent carbon atom (steric reasons) and vice versa.\nSimilarly, a primary alkyl halide will prefer a S 2 reaction, a secondary halide- S 2 or\nN N\nelimination depending upon the strength of base/nucleophile and a tertiary halide- S 1 or\nN\nelimination depending upon the stability of carbocation or the more substituted alkene.\n3.Reaction with metals\nMost organic chlorides, bromides and iodides react with certain\nmetals to give compounds containing carbon-metal bonds. Such\ncompounds are known as organo-metallic compounds. An\nimportant class of organo-metallic compounds discovered by Victor\nGrignard in 1900 is alkyl magnesium halide, RMgX, referred as\nGrignard Reagents. These reagents are obtained by the reaction of\nhaloalkanes with magnesium metal in dry ether.\nChemistry 180\nReprint 2025-26\nVictor Grignard had a strange start in academic life for a chemist - he\ntook a maths degree. When he eventually switched to chemistry, it was\nnot to the mathematical province of physical chemistry but to organic\nchemistry. While attempting to find an efficient catalyst for the process\nof methylation, he noted that Zn in diethyl ether had been used for this\npurpose and wondered whether the Mg/ether combination might be\nsuccessful. Grignard reagents were first reported in 1900 and Grignard\nused this work for his doctoral thesis in 1901. In 1910, Grignard obtained\na professorship at the University of Nancy and in 1912, he was awarded\nthe Nobel prize for Chemistry which he shared with Paul Sabatier who\nhad made advances in nickel catalysed hydrogenation.\nIn the Grignard reagent, the carbon-magnesium bond is covalent\nbut highly polar, with carbon pulling electrons from electropositive\nmagnesium; the magnesium halogen bond is essentially ionic.\nGrignard reagents are highly reactive and react with any source of\nproton to give hydrocarbons. Even water, alcohols, amines are sufficiently\nacidic to convert them to corresponding hydrocarbons.\nIt is therefore necessary to avoid even traces of moisture from a Grignard\nreagent. That is why reaction is carried out in dry ether. On the other\nhand, this could be considered as one of the methods for converting\nhalides to hydrocarbons.\nWurtz reaction\nAlkyl halides react with sodium in dry ether to give hydrocarbons\ncontaining double the number of carbon atoms present in the halide.\nThis reaction is known as Wurtz reaction.\n6.7.2 Reactionsof\n1. Nucleophilic substitution\nHaloarenes\nAryl halides are extremely less reactive towards nucleophilic\nsubstitution reactions due to the following reasons:\n(i) Resonance effect : In haloarenes, the electron pairs on halogen\natom are in conjugation with p-electrons of the ring and the\nfollowing resonating structures are possible.\nC—Cl bond acquires a partial double bond character due to\nresonance. As a result, the bond cleavage in haloarene is difficult\nthan haloalkane and therefore, they are less reactive towards\nnucleophilic substitution reaction.\n181 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\n(ii) Difference in hybridisation of carbon atom in C—X bond: In\nhaloalkane, the carbon atom attached to halogen is sp3\nhybridised while in case of haloarene, the carbon atom attached\nto halogen is sp2-hybridised.\nThe sp2 hybridised carbon with a greater s-character is more\nelectronegative and can hold the electron pair of C—X bond\nmore tightly than sp3-hybridised carbon in haloalkane with\nless s-chararcter. Thus, C—Cl bond length in haloalkane is\n177pm while in haloarene is 169 pm. Since it is difficult to\nbreak a shorter bond than a longer bond, therefore, haloarenes\nare less reactive than haloalkanes towards nucleophilic\nsubstitution reaction.\n(iii) Instability of phenyl cation: In case of haloarenes, the phenyl\ncation formed as a result of self-ionisation will not be stabilised\nby resonance and therefore, S 1 mechanism is ruled out.\nN\n(iv) Because of the possible repulsion, it is less likely for the electron\nrich nucleophile to approach electron rich arenes.\nReplacement by hydroxyl group\nChlorobenzene can be converted into phenol by heating in aqueous\nsodium hydroxide solution at a temperature of 623K and a pressure\nof 300 atmospheres.\nThe presence of an electron withdrawing group (-NO ) at ortho- and\n2\npara-positions increases the reactivity of haloarenes.\nChemistry 182\nReprint 2025-26\nThe effect is pronounced when (-NO ) group is introduced at ortho-\n2\nand para- positions. However, no effect on reactivity of haloarenes is\nobserved by the presence of electron withdrawing group at meta-position.\nMechanism of the reaction is as depicted:\nCan you think why does NO group show its effect only at ortho- and para- positions\n2\nand not at meta- position?\nAs shown, the presence of nitro group at ortho- and para-positions withdraws the\nelectron density from the benzene ring and thus facilitates the attack of the nucleophile\non haloarene. The carbanion thus formed is stabilised through resonance. The negative\ncharge appeared at ortho- and para- positions with respect to the halogen substituent is\nstabilised by –NO group while in case of meta-nitrobenzene, none of the resonating\n2\nstructures bear the negative charge on carbon atom bearing the –NO group. Therefore,\n2\nthe presence of nitro group at meta- position does not stabilise the negative charge and\nno effect on reactivity is observed by the presence of –NO group at meta-position.\n2\n183 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\n2. Electrophilic substitution reactions\nHaloarenes undergo the usual electrophilic reactions of the benzene\nring such as halogenation, nitration, sulphonation and Friedel-Crafts\nreactions. Halogen atom besides being slightly deactivating is o, p-\ndirecting; therefore, further substitution occurs at ortho- and para-\npositions with respect to the halogen atom. The o, p-directing influence\nof halogen atom can be easily understood if we consider the resonating\nstructures of halobenzene as shown:\nDue to resonance, the electron density increases more at ortho- and\npara-positions than at meta-positions. Further, the halogen atom\nbecause of its –I effect has some tendency to withdraw electrons from\nthe benzene ring. As a result, the ring gets somewhat deactivated as\ncompared to benzene and hence the electrophilic substitution reactions\nin haloarenes occur slowly and require more drastic conditions as\ncompared to those in benzene.\n(i) Halogenation\n(ii)Nitration\n(iii) Sulphonation\nChemistry 184\nReprint 2025-26\n(iv) Friedel-Crafts reaction\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 66666.....99999 Although chlorine is an electron withdrawing group, yet it is ortho-,\npara- directing in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. Why?\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn Chlorine withdraws electrons through inductive effect and releases\nelectrons through resonance. Through inductive effect, chlorine\ndestabilises the intermediate carbocation formed during the electrophilic\nsubstitution.\nThrough resonance, halogen tends to stabilise the carbocation and\nthe effect is more pronounced at ortho- and para- positions. The\ninductive effect is stronger than resonance and causes net electron\nwithdrawal and thus causes net deactivation. The resonance effect\ntends to oppose the inductive effect for the attack at ortho- and para-\npositions and hence makes the deactivation less for ortho- and para-\nattack. Reactivity is thus controlled by the stronger inductive effect\nand orientation is controlled by resonance effect.\n185 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\n3.

Many of these compounds are\nCCCCCooooommmmmpppppooooouuuuunnnnndddddsssss\nuseful in industry and agriculture. Some polyhalogen compounds are\ndescribed in this section.\n6.8.1 Dichloro- Dichloromethane is widely used as a solvent as a paint remover, as a\nmethane propellant in aerosols, and as a process solvent in the manufacture of\n(Methylene drugs. It is also used as a metal cleaning and finishing solvent. Methylene\nchloride) chloride harms the human central nervous system. Exposure to lower\nlevels of methylene chloride in air can lead to slightly impaired hearing\nand vision. Higher levels of methylene chloride in air cause dizziness,\nnausea, tingling and numbness in the fingers and toes. In humans, direct\nskin contact with methylene chloride causes intense burning and mild\nredness of the skin. Direct contact with the eyes can burn the cornea.\n6.8.2 Trichloro- Chemically, chloroform is employed as a solvent for fats, alkaloids,\nmethane iodine and other substances. The major use of chloroform today is in\n(Chloroform) the production of the freon refrigerant R-22. It was once used as a\ngeneral anaesthetic in surgery but has been replaced by less toxic,\nsafer anaesthetics, such as ether. As might be expected from its use as\nan anaesthetic, inhaling chloroform vapours depresses the central\nnervous system. Breathing about 900 parts of chloroform per million\nparts of air (900 parts per million) for a short time can cause dizziness,\nfatigue, and headache. Chronic chloroform exposure may cause damage\nto the liver (where chloroform is metabolised to phosgene) and to the\nkidneys, and some people develop sores when the skin is immersed in\nchloroform. Chloroform is slowly oxidised by air in the presence of\nlight to an extremely poisonous gas, carbonyl chloride, also known as\nphosgene. It is therefore stored in closed dark coloured bottles\ncompletely filled so that air is kept out.\n6.8.3 Triiodo- It was used earlier as an antiseptic but the antiseptic properties are\nmethane due to the liberation of free iodine and not due to iodoform itself. Due\n(Iodoform) to its objectionable smell, it has been replaced by other formulations\ncontaining iodine.\n6.8.4 Tetrachlo- It is produced in large quantities for use in the manufacture of\nromethane refrigerants and propellants for aerosol cans. It is also used as\n(Carbon feedstock in the synthesis of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals,\ntetrachloride) pharmaceutical manufacturing, and general solvent use. Until the mid\n1960s, it was also widely used as a cleaning fluid, both in industry,\nas a degreasing agent, and in the home, as a spot remover and as fire\nextinguisher. There is some evidence that exposure to carbon\ntetrachloride causes liver cancer in humans. The most common effects\nare dizziness, light headedness, nausea and vomiting, which can cause\npermanent damage to nerve cells. In severe cases, these effects can lead\nrapidly to stupor, coma, unconsciousness or death. Exposure to CCl\n4\ncan make the heart beat irregularly or stop. The chemical may irritate\nthe eyes on contact. When carbon tetrachloride is released into the air,\nit rises to the atmosphere and depletes the ozone layer. Depletion of the\n187 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\nozone layer is believed to increase human exposure to ultraviolet rays,\nleading to increased skin cancer, eye diseases and disorders, and\npossible disruption of the immune system.\n6.8.5 Freons The chlorofluorocarbon compounds of methane and ethane are collectively\nknown as freons. They are extremely stable, unreactive, non-toxic, non-\ncorrosive and easily liquefiable gases. Freon 12 (CCl F ) is one of the\n2 2\nmost common freons in industrial use. It is manufactured from\ntetrachloromethane by Swarts reaction. These are usually produced\nfor aerosol propellants, refrigeration and air conditioning purposes. By\n1974, total freon production in the world was about 2 billion pounds\nannually. Most freon, even that used in refrigeration, eventually makes\nits way into the atmosphere where it diffuses unchanged into the\nstratosphere. In stratosphere, freon is able to initiate radical chain\nreactions that can upset the natural ozone balance.\n6.8.6 p,p’-Dichlo- DDT, the first chlorinated organic insecticides, was originally prepared\nrodiphenyl- in 1873, but it was not until 1939 that Paul Muller of Geigy\ntrichloro- Pharmaceuticals in Switzerland discovered the effectiveness of DDT as\nethane(DDT) an insecticide. Paul Muller was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine\nand Physiology in 1948 for this discovery. The use of DDT increased\nenormously on a worldwide basis after World War II, primarily because\nof its effectiveness against the mosquito that spreads malaria and lice\nthat carry typhus. However, problems related to extensive use of DDT\nbegan to appear in the late 1940s. Many species of insects developed\nresistance to DDT, and it was also discovered to have a high toxicity\ntowards fish. The chemical stability of DDT and its fat solubility\ncompounded the problem. DDT is not metabolised very rapidly by\nanimals; instead, it is deposited and stored in the fatty tissues. If\ningestion continues at a steady rate, DDT builds up within the animal\nover time. The use of DDT was banned in the United States in 1973,\nalthough it is still in use in some other parts of the world.\nSSSSSuuuuummmmmmmmmmaaaaarrrrryyyyy\nAlkyl/ Aryl halides may be classified as mono, di, or polyhalogen (tri-, tetra-, etc.)\ncompounds depending on whether they contain one, two or more halogen atoms in\ntheir structures. Since halogen atoms are more electronegative than carbon, the carbon-\nhalogen bond of alkyl halide is polarised; the carbon atom bears a partial positive\ncharge, and the halogen atom bears a partial negative charge.\nAlkyl halides are prepared by the free radical halogenation of alkanes, addition\nof halogen acids to alkenes, replacement of –OH group of alcohols with halogens using\nChemistry 188\nReprint 2025-26\nphosphorus halides, thionyl chloride or halogen acids. Aryl halides are prepared by\nelectrophilic substitution to arenes. Fluorides and iodides are best prepared by halogen\nexchange method.\nThe boiling points of organohalogen compounds are comparatively higher than the\ncorresponding hydrocarbons because of strong dipole-dipole and van der Waals forces\nof attraction. These are slightly soluble in water but completely soluble in organic\nsolvents.\nThe polarity of carbon-halogen bond of alkyl halides is responsible for their\nnucleophilic substitution, elimination and their reaction with metal atoms to form\norganometallic compounds. Nucleophilic substitution reactions are categorised into\nS 1 and S 2 on the basis of their kinetic properties. Chirality has a profound role in\nN N\nunderstanding the reaction mechanisms of S 1 and S 2 reactions. S 2 reactions of\nN N N\nchiral alkyl halides are characterised by the inversion of configuration while S 1 reactions\nN\nare characterised by racemisation.\nA number of polyhalogen compounds e.g., dichloromethane, chloroform, iodoform,\ncarbon tetrachloride, freon and DDT have many industrial applications.

For example, Halogen Atoms Monohalocompounds may further be classified according to the hybridisation of the carbon atom to which the halogen is bonded, as discussed below. 6. 1. 2 Compounds This class includes Containing(a) Alkyl halides or haloalkanes(R X) sp3 C X In alkyl halides, the halogen atom is bonded to an alkyl group(R). Bond(X = F, They form a homologous series represented by C H X. They are Cl, Br, I) n 2n + 1 further classified as primary, secondary or tertiary according to the nature of carbon to which halogen is attached. If halogen is attached to a primary carbon atom in an alkyl halide, the alkyl halide is called primary alkyl halide or 1 ° alkyl halide. Similarly, if halogen is attached to secondary or tertiary carbon atom, the alkyl halide is called secondary alkyl halide(2 °) and tertiary(3 °) alkyl halide, respectively.(b) Allylic halides These are the compounds in which the halogen atom is bonded to an sp3 - hybridised carbon atom adjacent to carbon - carbon double bond(C = C) i. e.

The common names of alkyl halides are derived by naming the alkyl group followed by the name of halide. In the IUPAC system of nomenclature, alkyl halides are named as halosubstituted hydrocarbons. For mono halogen substituted derivatives of benzene, common and IUPAC names are the same. For dihalogen derivatives, the prefixes o -, m -, p - are used in common system but in IUPAC system, as you have learnt in Class XI, the numerals 1, 2; 1, 3 and 1, 4 are used. The dihaloalkanes having the same type of halogen atoms are named as alkylidene or alkylene dihalides. The dihalo - compounds having both the halogen atoms are further classified as geminal halides or gem - dihalides when both the halogen atoms are present on the same carbon atom of the 161 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes Reprint 2025 - 26 chain and vicinal halides or vic - dihalides when halogen atoms are present on adjacent carbon atoms. In common name system, gem - dihalides are named as alkylidene halides and vic - dihalides are named as alkylene dihalides. In IUPAC system, they are named as dihaloalkanes.

As we go down the group in the periodic table, the size of halogen atom increases. Fluorine atom is the smallest and iodine atom is the largest. Consequently the carbon - halogen bond length also increases from C F to C I. Some typical bond lengths, bond enthalpies and dipole moments are given in Table 6. 2. Alkyl halides are best prepared from alcohols, which are easily accessible. 163 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes Reprint 2025 - 26 Table 6. 2: Carbon - Halogen(C X) Bond Lengths, Bond Enthalpies and Dipole Moments Bond Bond length / pm C - X Bond enthalpies / Kjmol - 1 Dipole moment / Debye CH F 139 452 1. 847 3 CH Cl 178 351 1. 860 3 CH Br 193 293 1. 830 3 CH I 214 234 1. 636 3 66666. 44444 Methods of The hydroxyl group of an alcohol is replaced by halogen on reaction with Preparation concentrated halogen acids, phosphorus halides or thionyl chloride. Thionyl chloride is preferred because in this reaction alkyl halide is formed of Haloalkanes along with gases SO and Hcl. The two gaseous products are escapable, 2 hence, the reaction gives pure alkyl halides. The reactions of primary and 6. 4. 1 From Alcohols secondary alcohols with Hcl require the presence of a catalyst, Zncl. 2 With tertiary alcohols, the reaction is conducted by simply shaking the alcohol with concentrated Hcl at room temperature. Constant boiling with Hbr(48 %) is used for preparing alkyl bromide. Good yields of R I may be obtained by heating alcohols with sodium or potassium iodide in 95 % orthophosphoric acid. The order of reactivity of alcohols with a given haloacid is 3 ° > 2 ° > 1 °. Phosphorus tribromide and triiodide are usually generated in situ(produced in the reaction mixture) by the reaction of red phosphorus with bromine and iodine respectively. The preparation of alkyl chloride is carried out either by passing dry hydrogen chloride gas through a solution of alcohol or by heating a mixture of alcohol and concentrated aqueous halogen acid. The above methods are not applicable for the preparation of aryl halides because the carbon - oxygen bond in phenols has a partial double bond character and is difficult to break being stronger than a single bond. 6. 4. 2 From(I) From alkanes by free radical halogenation Hydrocarbons Free radical chlorination or bromination of alkanes gives a complex mixture of isomeric mono - and polyhaloalkanes, which is difficult to Chemistry 164 Reprint 2025 - 26 separate as pure compounds. Consequently, the yield of any single compound is low.(II) From alkenes(i) Addition of hydrogen halides: An alkene is converted to corresponding alkyl halide by reaction with hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide or hydrogen iodide. Propene yields two products, however only one predominates as per Markovnikov s rule.(Unit 13, Class XI)(ii) Addition of halogens: In the laboratory, addition of bromine in Ccl to an alkene resulting in discharge of reddish brown colour 4 of bromine constitutes an important method for the detection of double bond in a molecule. The addition results in the synthesis of vic - dibromides, which are colourless(Unit 9, Class XI).

This reaction is known as Finkelstein reaction. Nacl or Nabr thus formed is precipitated in dry acetone. It facilitates the forward reaction according to Le Chatelier s Principle. The synthesis of alkyl fluorides is best accomplished by heating an alkyl chloride / bromide in the presence of a metallic fluoride such as 165 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes Reprint 2025 - 26 Agf, Hg F, Cof or Sbf. The reaction is termed as Swarts reaction. 2 2 2 3 66666. 55555 Preparation of(i) From hydrocarbons by electrophilic substitution Haloarenes Aryl chlorides and bromides can be easily prepared by electrophilic substitution of arenes with chlorine and bromine respectively in the presence of Lewis acid catalysts like iron or iron(I) chloride. The ortho and para isomers can be easily separated due to large difference in their melting points. Reactions with iodine are reversible in nature and require the presence of an oxidising agent(HNO, 3 HIO) to oxidise the HI formed during iodination. Fluoro compounds 4 are not prepared by this method due to high reactivity of fluorine.(ii) From amines by Sandmeyer s reaction When a primary aromatic amine, dissolved or suspended in cold aqueous mineral acid, is treated with sodium nitrite, a diazonium salt is formed. Mixing the solution of freshly prepared diazonium salt with cuprous chloride or cuprous bromide results in the replacement of the diazonium group by Cl or Br. Replacement of the diazonium group by iodine does not require the presence of cuprous halide and is done simply by shaking the diazonium salt with potassium iodide.

However, bromides and iodides develop colour when exposed to light. Many volatile halogen compounds Properties have sweet smell. 167 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes Reprint 2025 - 26 Melting and boiling points Methyl chloride, methyl bromide, ethyl chloride and some chlorofluoromethanes are gases at room temperature. Higher members are liquids or solids. As we have already learnt, molecules of organic halogen compounds are generally polar. Due to greater polarity as well as higher molecular mass as compared to the parent hydrocarbon, the intermolecular forces of attraction(dipole - dipole and van der Waals) are stronger in the halogen derivatives. That is why the boiling points of chlorides, bromides and iodides are considerably higher than those of the hydrocarbons of comparable molecular mass. The attractions get stronger as the molecules get bigger in size and have more electrons. The pattern of variation of boiling points of different halides is depicted in Fig. 6. 1. For the same alkyl group, the boiling points of alkyl halides decrease in the order: RI > Rbr > Rcl > RF. This is because with the increase in size and mass of halogen atom, the magnitude of van der Waal forces increases. Fig. 6. 1: Comparison of boiling points of some alkyl halides The boiling points of isomeric haloalkanes decrease with increase in branching. For example, 2 - bromo - 2 - methylpropane has the lowest boiling point among the three isomers. Boiling points of isomeric dihalobenzenes are very nearly the same. However, the para - isomers are high melting as compared to their ortho - and meta - isomers. It is due to symmetry of para - isomers that fits in crystal lattice better as compared to ortho - and meta - isomers. Chemistry 168 Reprint 2025 - 26 Density Bromo, iodo and polychloro derivatives of hydrocarbons are heavier than water. The density increases with increase in number of carbon atoms, halogen atoms and atomic mass of the halogen atoms(Table 6. 3).

In order to dissolve haloalkane in water, energy is required to overcome the attractions between the haloalkane molecules and break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Less energy is released when new attractions are set up between the haloalkane and the water molecules as these are not as strong as the original hydrogen bonds in water. As a result, the solubility of haloalkanes in water is low. However, haloalkanes tend to dissolve in organic solvents because the new intermolecular attractions between haloalkanes and solvent molecules have much the same strength as the ones being broken in the separate haloalkane and solvent molecules.

Nucleophilic substitution 2. Elimination reactions 6. 7. 1 Reactions of 3. Reaction with metals. Haloalkanes(1) Nucleophilic substitution reactions You have learnt in Class XI that nucleophiles are electron rich species. Therefore, they attack at that part of the substrate molecule which is electron deficient. The reaction in which a nucleophile replaces 169 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes Reprint 2025 - 26 already existing nucleophile in a molecule is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. Haloalkanes are substrate in these reactions. In this type of reaction, a nucleophile reacts with haloalkane(the substrate) having a partial positive charge on the carbon atom bonded to halogen. A substitution reaction takes place and halogen atom, called leaving group departs as halide ion. Since the substitution reaction is initiated by a nucleophile, it is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. It is one of the most useful classes of organic reactions of alkyl halides in which halogen is bonded to sp3 hybridised carbon. The products formed by the reaction of haloalkanes with some common nucleophiles are given in Table 6. 4.

Actually cyanide group is a hybrid of two contributing structures and therefore can act as a nucleophile in two different ways[VC N «: C = NV], i. e., linking through Chemistry 170 Reprint 2025 - 26 Haloalkanes react with KCN to form alkyl cyanides as main product Example 66666. 55555 while AgCN forms isocyanides as the chief product. Explain. KCN is predominantly ionic and provides cyanide ions in solution. Solution Although both carbon and nitrogen atoms are in a position to donate electron pairs, the attack takes place mainly through carbon atom and not through nitrogen atom since C C bond is more stable than C N bond. However, AgCN is mainly covalent in nature and nitrogen is free to donate electron pair forming isocyanide as the main product. Carbon atom resulting in alkyl cyanides and through nitrogen atom leading to isocyanides. Similarly nitrite ion also represents an ambident ii nucleophile with two different points of linkage[O N = O]. The linkage through oxygen results in alkyl nitrites while through nitrogen atom, it leads to nitroalkanes. Mechanism: This reaction has been found to proceed by two different mechanims which are described below:(a) Substitution nucleophilic bimolecular(S 2) N The reaction between CH Cl and hydroxide ion to yield methanol and 3 chloride ion follows a second order kinetics, i. e., the rate depends upon the concentration of both the reactants. The solid wedge represents the bond coming out of the paper, dashed line going down the paper and a straight line representing bond in the plane of the paper. The above reaction can be represented diagrammatically as shown in Fig. 6. 2. Fig. 6. 2: Red ball represents the incoming hydroxide ion and green ball represents the outgoing halide ion In the year 1937, It depicts a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution(S 2) reaction; N Edward Davies Hughes the incoming nucleophile interacts with alkyl halide causing the and Sir Christopher carbon - halide bond to break and a new bond is formed between Ingold proposed a carbon and attacking nucleophile. Here it is C - O bond formed between mechanism for an S 2 reaction. N C and - OH. These two processes take place simultaneously in a 171 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes Reprint 2025 - 26 single step and no intermediate is formed. As the reaction progresses and the bond between the incoming nucleophile and the carbon atom starts forming, the bond between carbon atom and leaving group weakens. As this happens, the three carbon - hydrogen bonds of the substrate start moving away from the attacking nucleophile. In transition state all the three C - H bonds are in the same plane and the attacking and leaving nucleophiles are partially attached to the carbon. As the attacking nucleophile approaches closer to the carbon, C - H bonds still keep on moving in the same direction till the attacking nucleophile attaches to carbon and leaving group leaves the carbon. As a result configuration is inverted, the configuration(See box) of carbon atom under attack inverts in much the same way as an umbrella is turned inside out when caught in a strong wind. This process is called as inversion of configuration. In the transition state, the carbon atom is simultaneously bonded to incoming nucleophile and the outgoing leaving group. Such structures are unstable and cannot be isolated. Thus, in the transition state, carbon is simultaneously bonded to five atoms. Configuration Spacial arrangement of functional groups around carbon is called its configuration. See the structures(A) and(B) given below carefully. These are the two structures of the same compound. They differ in spacial arrangement of functional groups attached to carbon. Structure(A) is mirror image of Structure(B). We say configuration of carbon in structure(A) is mirror image of the configuration of carbon in structure(B).

Degree from the on or near the carbon atom have a dramatic inhibiting effect. Of the University of London. Simple alkyl halides, methyl halides react most rapidly in S 2 reactions N because there are only three small hydrogen atoms. Tertiary halides are the least reactive because bulky groups hinder the approaching Chemistry 172 Reprint 2025 - 26 nucleophiles. Thus the order of reactivity followed is: Primary halide > Secondary halide > Tertiary halide. Fig. 6. 3: Steric effects in S 2 reaction. The relative rate of S 2 reaction is given in parenthesis N N(b) Substitution nucleophilic unimolecular(S 1) N S 1 reactions are generally carried out in polar protic solvents N(like water, alcohol, acetic acid, etc.). The reaction between tert - butyl bromide and hydroxide ion yields tert - butyl alcohol and follows the first order kinetics, i. e., the rate of reaction depends upon the concentration of only one reactant, which is tert - butyl bromide. It occurs in two steps. In step I, the polarised C Br bond undergoes slow cleavage to produce a carbocation and a bromide ion. The carbocation thus formed is then attacked by nucleophile in step II to complete the substitution reaction. 173 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes Reprint 2025 - 26 Step I is the slowest and reversible. It involves the C Br bond breaking for which the energy is obtained through solvation of halide ion with the proton of protic solvent. Since the rate of reaction depends upon the slowest step, the rate of reaction depends only on the concentration of alkyl halide and not on the concentration of hydroxide ion. Further, greater the stability of carbocation, greater will be its ease of formation from alkyl halide and faster will be the rate of reaction. In case of alkyl halides, 30 alkyl halides undergo S 1 reaction N very fast because of the high stability of 30 carbocations. We can sum up the order of reactivity of alkyl halides towards S 1 and S 2 reactions as follows: N N For the same reasons, allylic and benzylic halides show high reactivity towards the S 1 N reaction. The carbocation thus formed gets stabilised through resonance(Unit 8, Class XI) as shown below: + + H C C CH H C C CH 2 H 2 2 H 2 For a given alkyl group, the reactivity of the halide, R - X, follows the same order in both the mechanisms R I > R Br > R Cl > > R F.

As iodine is a better leaving group because of its large size, it will be released at a faster rate in the presence of incoming nucleophile.

Such compounds are called optically active compounds. The angle William Nicol(1768 - by which the plane polarised light is rotated is measured by an 1851) developed the first instrument called polarimeter. If the compound rotates the plane prism that produced of plane polarised light to the right, i. e., clockwise direction, it plane polarised light. Is called dextrorotatory(Greek for right rotating) or the d - form and is indicated by placing a positive(+) sign before the degree of rotation. If the light is rotated towards left(anticlockwise direction), the compound is said to be laevo - rotatory or the l - form and a negative() sign is placed before the degree of rotation. Such(+) and() isomers of a compound are called optical isomers and the phenomenon is termed as optical isomerism.(ii) Molecular asymmetry, chirality and enantiomers: The observation of Louis Pasteur(1848) that crystals of certain compounds exist in the form of mirror images laid the foundation of modern stereochemistry. He demonstrated that aqueous solutions of both types of crystals showed optical rotation, equal in magnitude(for solution of equal concentration) but opposite in direction. He believed that this difference in optical activity was associated with the three dimensional arrangements of atoms in the molecules(configurations) of 175 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes Reprint 2025 - 26 two types of crystals. Dutch scientist, J. Van t Hoff and French scientist, C. Le Bel in the same year(1874), independently argued that the spatial arrangement of four groups(valencies) Jacobus Hendricus around a central carbon is tetrahedral and if all the substituents Van t Hoff(1852 - 1911) attached to that carbon are different, the mirror image of the received the first Nobel molecule is not superimposed(overlapped) on the molecule; Prize in Chemistry in 1901 for his work on such a carbon is called asymmetric carbon or stereocentre. Solutions. The resulting molecule would lack symmetry and is referred to as asymmetric molecule. The asymmetry of the molecule along with non superimposability of mirror images is responsible for the optical activity in such organic compounds. The symmetry and asymmetry are also observed in many day to day objects: a sphere, a cube, a cone, are all identical to their mirror images and can be superimposed. However, many objects are non superimposable on their mirror images. For example, your left and right hand look similar but if you put your left hand on your right hand by moving them in the same plane, they do not coincide. The objects which are non - superimposable on their mirror image(like a pair of hands) are said to be chiral and this property is known as chirality. Chiral molecules are optically active, while the objects, which are, superimposable on their mirror images are called achiral. These molecules are optically inactive. The above test of molecular chirality can be applied to organic molecules by constructing models and its mirror images or by drawing three dimensional structures and attempting to superimpose them in our minds. There are other aids, however, that can assist us in recognising chiral molecules. One such aid is the presence of Fig 6. 4: Some common examples of chiral and a single asymmetric carbon atom. Let us consider achiral objects two simple molecules propan - 2 - ol(Fig. 6. 5) and butan - 2 - ol(Fig. 6. 6) and their mirror images. Fig 6. 5: B is mirror image of A; B is rotated by 180o and C is obtained; C is superimposable on A. As you can see very clearly, propan - 2 - ol(A) does not contain an asymmetric carbon, as all the four groups attached to the tetrahedral carbon are not different. We rotate the mirror image(B) of the molecule by 180 °(structure C) and try to overlap the structure(C) with the structure(A), these structures completely overlap. Thus propan - 2 - ol is an achiral molecule. Chemistry 176 Reprint 2025 - 26 Fig 6. 6: E is mirror image of D; E is rotated by 180o to get F and F is non superimposable on its mirror image D. Butan - 2 - ol has four different groups attached to the tetrahedral carbon and as expected is chiral. Some common examples of chiral molecules such as 2 - chlorobutane, 2, 3 - dihyroxypropanal,(OHC CHOH CH OH), 2 bromochloro - iodomethane(BrClCHI), 2 - bromopropanoic acid(H C CHBr COOH), etc. 3 Fig. 6. 7: A chiral molecule The stereoisomers related to each other as non - and its mirror image superimposable mirror images are called enantiomers(Fig. 6. 7). A and B in Fig. 6. 5 and D and E in Fig. 6. 6 are enantiomers. Enantiomers possess identical physical properties namely, melting point, boiling point, refractive index, etc. They only differ with respect to the rotation of plane polarised light. If one of the enantiomer is dextro rotatory, the other will be laevo rotatory. However, the sign of optical rotation is not necessarily related to the absolute(actual) configuration of the molecule. A mixture containing two enantiomers in equal proportions will have zero optical rotation, as the rotation due to one isomer will be cancelled by the rotation due to the other isomer. Such a mixture is known as racemic mixture or racemic modification. A racemic mixture is represented by prefixing dl or() before the name, for example() butan - 2 - ol. The process of conversion of enantiomer into a racemic mixture is known as racemisation. Example 66666. 88888 Identify chiral and achiral molecules in each of the following pair of compounds.(Wedge and Dash representations according to Class XI. 177 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes Reprint 2025 - 26 Solution(i) Retention: Retention of configuration is the preservation of the spatial arrangement of bonds to an asymmetric centre during a chemical reaction or transformation. In general, if during a reaction, no bond to the stereocentre is broken, the product will have the same general configuration of groups around the stereocentre as that of reactant. Such a reaction is said to proceed with retention of the configuration. Consider as an example, the reaction that takes place when() - 2 - methylbutan - 1 - ol is heated with concentrated hydrochloric acid. It is important to note that configuration at a symmetric centre in the reactant and product is same but the sign of optical rotation has changed in the product. This is so because two different compounds with same configuration at asymmetric centre may have different optical rotation. One may be dextrorotatory(plus sign of optical rotation) while other may be laevorotatory(negative sign of optical rotation).(iv) Inversion, retention and racemisation: There are three outcomes for a reaction at an asymmetric carbon atom, when a bond directly linked to an asymmetric carbon atom is broken. Consider the replacement of a group X by Y in the following reaction; If(A) is the only compound obtained, the process is called retention of configuration. Note that configuration has been rotated in A. If(B) is the only compound obtained, the process is called inversion of configuration. Configuration has been inverted in B. Chemistry 178 Reprint 2025 - 26 If a 50: 50 mixture of A and B is obtained then the process is called racemisation and the product is optically inactive, as one isomer will rotate the plane polarised light in the direction opposite to another. Now let us have a fresh look at S 1 and S 2 mechanisms by N N taking examples of optically active alkyl halides. In case of optically active alkyl halides, the product formed as a result of S 2 mechanism has the inverted configuration as compared N to the reactant. This is because the nucleophile attaches itself on the side opposite to the one where the halogen atom is present. When() - 2 - bromooctane is allowed to react with sodium hydroxide,(+) - octan - 2 - ol is formed with the OH group occupying the position opposite to what bromide had occupied. Thus, S 2 reactions of optically active halides are accompanied by N inversion of configuration. In case of optically active alkyl halides, S 1 reactions are N accompanied by racemisation. Can you think of the reason why it happens? Actually the carbocation formed in the slow step being sp2 hybridised is planar(achiral). The attack of the nucleophile may be accomplished from either side of the plane of carbocation resulting in a mixture of products, one having the same configuration(the OH attaching on the same position as halide ion) and the other having Location of a and opposite configuration(the OH attaching on the side opposite to halide b carbon in a ion). This may be illustrated by hydrolysis of optically active molecule 2 - bromobutane, which results in the formation of() - butan - 2 - ol. Carbon on which 2. Elimination reactions halogen atom is When a haloalkane with b - hydrogen atom is heated with alcoholic directly attached is solution of potassium hydroxide, there is elimination of hydrogen called a - carbon and atom from b - carbon and a halogen atom from the a - carbon atom. The carbon atom adjacent to this carbon is called b - carbon. 179 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes Reprint 2025 - 26 As a result, an alkene is formed as a product. Since b - hydrogen atom is involved in elimination, it is often called b - elimination. If there is possibility of formation of more than one alkene due to the availability of more than one b - hydrogen atoms, usually one alkene is formed as the major product. These form part of a pattern first observed by Russian chemist, Alexander Zaitsev(also pronounced as Saytzeff) who in 1875 formulated a rule which can be summarised as in dehydrohalogenation reactions, the preferred product is that alkene which has the greater number of alkyl groups attached to the doubly bonded carbon atoms. Thus, 2 - bromopentane gives pent - 2 - ene as the major product. Elimination versus substitution A chemical reaction is the result of competition; it is a race that is won by the fastest runner. A collection of molecules tend to do, by and large, what is easiest for them. An alkyl halide with b - hydrogen atoms when reacted with a base or a nucleophile has two competing routes: substitution(S 1 and S 2) and elimination. Which route will be taken N N up depends upon the nature of alkyl halide, strength and size of base / nucleophile and reaction conditions. Thus, a bulkier nucleophile will prefer to act as a base and abstracts a proton rather than approach a tetravalent carbon atom(steric reasons) and vice versa. Similarly, a primary alkyl halide will prefer a S 2 reaction, a secondary halide - S 2 or N N elimination depending upon the strength of base / nucleophile and a tertiary halide - S 1 or N elimination depending upon the stability of carbocation or the more substituted alkene. 3. Reaction with metals Most organic chlorides, bromides and iodides react with certain metals to give compounds containing carbon - metal bonds. Such compounds are known as organo - metallic compounds. An important class of organo - metallic compounds discovered by Victor Grignard in 1900 is alkyl magnesium halide, RMgX, referred as Grignard Reagents. These reagents are obtained by the reaction of haloalkanes with magnesium metal in dry ether. Chemistry 180 Reprint 2025 - 26 Victor Grignard had a strange start in academic life for a chemist - he took a maths degree. When he eventually switched to chemistry, it was not to the mathematical province of physical chemistry but to organic chemistry. While attempting to find an efficient catalyst for the process of methylation, he noted that Zn in diethyl ether had been used for this purpose and wondered whether the Mg / ether combination might be successful. Grignard reagents were first reported in 1900 and Grignard used this work for his doctoral thesis in 1901. In 1910, Grignard obtained a professorship at the University of Nancy and in 1912, he was awarded the Nobel prize for Chemistry which he shared with Paul Sabatier who had made advances in nickel catalysed hydrogenation. In the Grignard reagent, the carbon - magnesium bond is covalent but highly polar, with carbon pulling electrons from electropositive magnesium; the magnesium halogen bond is essentially ionic. Grignard reagents are highly reactive and react with any source of proton to give hydrocarbons. Even water, alcohols, amines are sufficiently acidic to convert them to corresponding hydrocarbons. It is therefore necessary to avoid even traces of moisture from a Grignard reagent. That is why reaction is carried out in dry ether. On the other hand, this could be considered as one of the methods for converting halides to hydrocarbons. Wurtz reaction Alkyl halides react with sodium in dry ether to give hydrocarbons containing double the number of carbon atoms present in the halide. This reaction is known as Wurtz reaction. 6. 7. 2 Reactionsof 1. Nucleophilic substitution Haloarenes Aryl halides are extremely less reactive towards nucleophilic substitution reactions due to the following reasons:(i) Resonance effect: In haloarenes, the electron pairs on halogen atom are in conjugation with p - electrons of the ring and the following resonating structures are possible. C Cl bond acquires a partial double bond character due to resonance. As a result, the bond cleavage in haloarene is difficult than haloalkane and therefore, they are less reactive towards nucleophilic substitution reaction. 181 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes Reprint 2025 - 26(ii) Difference in hybridisation of carbon atom in C X bond: In haloalkane, the carbon atom attached to halogen is sp3 hybridised while in case of haloarene, the carbon atom attached to halogen is sp2 - hybridised. The sp2 hybridised carbon with a greater s - character is more electronegative and can hold the electron pair of C X bond more tightly than sp3 - hybridised carbon in haloalkane with less s - chararcter. Thus, C Cl bond length in haloalkane is 177pm while in haloarene is 169 pm. Since it is difficult to break a shorter bond than a longer bond, therefore, haloarenes are less reactive than haloalkanes towards nucleophilic substitution reaction.(i) Instability of phenyl cation: In case of haloarenes, the phenyl cation formed as a result of self - ionisation will not be stabilised by resonance and therefore, S 1 mechanism is ruled out. N(iv) Because of the possible repulsion, it is less likely for the electron rich nucleophile to approach electron rich arenes. Replacement by hydroxyl group Chlorobenzene can be converted into phenol by heating in aqueous sodium hydroxide solution at a temperature of 623K and a pressure of 300 atmospheres. The presence of an electron withdrawing group(- NO) at ortho - and 2 para - positions increases the reactivity of haloarenes. Chemistry 182 Reprint 2025 - 26 The effect is pronounced when(- NO) group is introduced at ortho - 2 and para - positions. However, no effect on reactivity of haloarenes is observed by the presence of electron withdrawing group at meta - position. Mechanism of the reaction is as depicted: Can you think why does NO group show its effect only at ortho - and para - positions 2 and not at meta - position? As shown, the presence of nitro group at ortho - and para - positions withdraws the electron density from the benzene ring and thus facilitates the attack of the nucleophile on haloarene. The carbanion thus formed is stabilised through resonance. The negative charge appeared at ortho - and para - positions with respect to the halogen substituent is stabilised by NO group while in case of meta - nitrobenzene, none of the resonating 2 structures bear the negative charge on carbon atom bearing the NO group. Therefore, 2 the presence of nitro group at meta - position does not stabilise the negative charge and no effect on reactivity is observed by the presence of NO group at meta - position. 2 183 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes Reprint 2025 - 26 2. Electrophilic substitution reactions Haloarenes undergo the usual electrophilic reactions of the benzene ring such as halogenation, nitration, sulphonation and Friedel - Crafts reactions. Halogen atom besides being slightly deactivating is o, p - directing; therefore, further substitution occurs at ortho - and para - positions with respect to the halogen atom. The o, p - directing influence of halogen atom can be easily understood if we consider the resonating structures of halobenzene as shown: Due to resonance, the electron density increases more at ortho - and para - positions than at meta - positions. Further, the halogen atom because of its I effect has some tendency to withdraw electrons from the benzene ring. As a result, the ring gets somewhat deactivated as compared to benzene and hence the electrophilic substitution reactions in haloarenes occur slowly and require more drastic conditions as compared to those in benzene.(i) Halogenation(ii) Nitration(i) Sulphonation Chemistry 184 Reprint 2025 - 26(iv) Friedel - Crafts reaction Example 66666. 99999 Although chlorine is an electron withdrawing group, yet it is ortho -, para - directing in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. Why? Solution Chlorine withdraws electrons through inductive effect and releases electrons through resonance. Through inductive effect, chlorine destabilises the intermediate carbocation formed during the electrophilic substitution. Through resonance, halogen tends to stabilise the carbocation and the effect is more pronounced at ortho - and para - positions. The inductive effect is stronger than resonance and causes net electron withdrawal and thus causes net deactivation. The resonance effect tends to oppose the inductive effect for the attack at ortho - and para - positions and hence makes the deactivation less for ortho - and para - attack. Reactivity is thus controlled by the stronger inductive effect and orientation is controlled by resonance effect. 185 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes Reprint 2025 - 26 3. Reaction with metals Wurtz - Fittig reaction A mixture of an alkyl halide and aryl halide gives an alkylarene when treated with sodium in dry ether and is called Wurtz - Fittig reaction.

Many of these compounds are Compounds useful in industry and agriculture. Some polyhalogen compounds are described in this section. 6. 8. 1 Dichloro - Dichloromethane is widely used as a solvent as a paint remover, as a methane propellant in aerosols, and as a process solvent in the manufacture of(Methylene drugs. It is also used as a metal cleaning and finishing solvent. Methylene chloride) chloride harms the human central nervous system. Exposure to lower levels of methylene chloride in air can lead to slightly impaired hearing and vision. Higher levels of methylene chloride in air cause dizziness, nausea, tingling and numbness in the fingers and toes. In humans, direct skin contact with methylene chloride causes intense burning and mild redness of the skin. Direct contact with the eyes can burn the cornea. 6. 8. 2 Trichloro - Chemically, chloroform is employed as a solvent for fats, alkaloids, methane iodine and other substances. The major use of chloroform today is in(Chloroform) the production of the freon refrigerant R - 22. It was once used as a general anaesthetic in surgery but has been replaced by less toxic, safer anaesthetics, such as ether. As might be expected from its use as an anaesthetic, inhaling chloroform vapours depresses the central nervous system. Breathing about 900 parts of chloroform per million parts of air(900 parts per million) for a short time can cause dizziness, fatigue, and headache. Chronic chloroform exposure may cause damage to the liver(where chloroform is metabolised to phosgene) and to the kidneys, and some people develop sores when the skin is immersed in chloroform. Chloroform is slowly oxidised by air in the presence of light to an extremely poisonous gas, carbonyl chloride, also known as phosgene. It is therefore stored in closed dark coloured bottles completely filled so that air is kept out. 6. 8. 3 Triiodo - It was used earlier as an antiseptic but the antiseptic properties are methane due to the liberation of free iodine and not due to iodoform itself. Due(Iodoform) to its objectionable smell, it has been replaced by other formulations containing iodine. 6. 8. 4 Tetrachlo - It is produced in large quantities for use in the manufacture of romethane refrigerants and propellants for aerosol cans. It is also used as(Carbon feedstock in the synthesis of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals, tetrachloride) pharmaceutical manufacturing, and general solvent use. Until the mid 1960s, it was also widely used as a cleaning fluid, both in industry, as a degreasing agent, and in the home, as a spot remover and as fire extinguisher. There is some evidence that exposure to carbon tetrachloride causes liver cancer in humans. The most common effects are dizziness, light headedness, nausea and vomiting, which can cause permanent damage to nerve cells. In severe cases, these effects can lead rapidly to stupor, coma, unconsciousness or death. Exposure to Ccl 4 can make the heart beat irregularly or stop. The chemical may irritate the eyes on contact. When carbon tetrachloride is released into the air, it rises to the atmosphere and depletes the ozone layer. Depletion of the 187 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes Reprint 2025 - 26 ozone layer is believed to increase human exposure to ultraviolet rays, leading to increased skin cancer, eye diseases and disorders, and possible disruption of the immune system. 6. 8. 5 Freons The chlorofluorocarbon compounds of methane and ethane are collectively known as freons. They are extremely stable, unreactive, non - toxic, non - corrosive and easily liquefiable gases. Freon 12(Ccl F) is one of the 2 2 most common freons in industrial use. It is manufactured from tetrachloromethane by Swarts reaction. These are usually produced for aerosol propellants, refrigeration and air conditioning purposes. By 1974, total freon production in the world was about 2 billion pounds annually. Most freon, even that used in refrigeration, eventually makes its way into the atmosphere where it diffuses unchanged into the stratosphere. In stratosphere, freon is able to initiate radical chain reactions that can upset the natural ozone balance. 6. 8. 6 p, p - Dichlo - DDT, the first chlorinated organic insecticides, was originally prepared rodiphenyl - in 1873, but it was not until 1939 that Paul Muller of Geigy trichloro - Pharmaceuticals in Switzerland discovered the effectiveness of DDT as ethane(DDT) an insecticide. Paul Muller was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1948 for this discovery. The use of DDT increased enormously on a worldwide basis after World War II, primarily because of its effectiveness against the mosquito that spreads malaria and lice that carry typhus. However, problems related to extensive use of DDT began to appear in the late 1940s. Many species of insects developed resistance to DDT, and it was also discovered to have a high toxicity towards fish. The chemical stability of DDT and its fat solubility compounded the problem. DDT is not metabolised very rapidly by animals; instead, it is deposited and stored in the fatty tissues. If ingestion continues at a steady rate, DDT builds up within the animal over time. The use of DDT was banned in the United States in 1973, although it is still in use in some other parts of the world. Sumary Alkyl / Aryl halides may be classified as mono, di, or polyhalogen(tri -, tetra -, etc.) compounds depending on whether they contain one, two or more halogen atoms in their structures. Since halogen atoms are more electronegative than carbon, the carbon - halogen bond of alkyl halide is polarised; the carbon atom bears a partial positive charge, and the halogen atom bears a partial negative charge. Alkyl halides are prepared by the free radical halogenation of alkanes, addition of halogen acids to alkenes, replacement of OH group of alcohols with halogens using Chemistry 188 Reprint 2025 - 26 phosphorus halides, thionyl chloride or halogen acids. Aryl halides are prepared by electrophilic substitution to arenes. Fluorides and iodides are best prepared by halogen exchange method. The boiling points of organohalogen compounds are comparatively higher than the corresponding hydrocarbons because of strong dipole - dipole and van der Waals forces of attraction. These are slightly soluble in water but completely soluble in organic solvents. The polarity of carbon - halogen bond of alkyl halides is responsible for their nucleophilic substitution, elimination and their reaction with metal atoms to form organometallic compounds. Nucleophilic substitution reactions are categorised into S 1 and S 2 on the basis of their kinetic properties. Chirality has a profound role in N N understanding the reaction mechanisms of S 1 and S 2 reactions. S 2 reactions of N N N chiral alkyl halides are characterised by the inversion of configuration while S 1 reactions N are characterised by racemisation. A number of polyhalogen compounds e. g., dichloromethane, chloroform, iodoform, carbon tetrachloride, freon and DDT have many industrial applications. However, some of these compounds cannot be easily decomposed and even cause depletion of ozone layer and are proving environmental hazards.

Therefore, let us first learn how are alcohols, phenols\nand ethers classified?\n7.1.1 Alcohols— Alcohols and phenols may be classified as mono–, di–, tri- or\nMono, Di, polyhydric compounds depending on whether they contain one, two,\nTri or three or many hydroxyl groups respectively in their structures as\nPolyhydric given below:\nalcohols\nMonohydric Dihydric Trihydric\nMonohydric alcohols may be further classified according to the\nhybridisation of the carbon atom to which the hydroxyl group is\nattached.\n(i) Compounds containing C OHbond: In this class of alcohols,\nsp3\nthe –OH group is attached to an sp3 hybridised carbon atom of an\nalkyl group. They are further classified as follows:\nPrimary, secondary and tertiary alcohols: In these three types of\nalcohols, the –OH group is attached to primary, secondary and\ntertiary carbon atom, respectively as depicted below:\nAllylic alcohols: In these alcohols, the —OH group is attached to\na sp3 hybridised carbon adjacent to the carbon-carbon double\nbond, that is to an allylic carbon. For example\nBenzylic alcohols: In these alcohols, the —OH group is attached\nto a sp3—hybridised carbon atom next to an aromatic ring. For\nexample.\nChemistry 194\nReprint 2025-26\nAllylic and benzylic alcohols may be primary, secondary or tertiary.\n(ii) Compounds containing C OH bond: These alcohols contain\nsp2\n—OH group bonded to a carbon-carbon double bond, i.e., to a\nvinylic carbon or to an aryl carbon. These alcohols are also known\nas vinylic alcohols.\nVinylic alcohol: CH = CH – OH\n2\n7.1.2 Phenols—\nMono, Di\nand\ntrihydric\nphenols\nMonohydric\n7.1.3 Ethers Ethers are classified as simple or symmetrical, if the alkyl or aryl\ngroups attached to the oxygen atom are the same, and mixed or\nunsymmetrical, if the two groups are different. Diethyl ether,\nC H OC H , is a symmetrical ether whereas C H OCH and C H OC H\n2 5 2 5 2 5 3 2 5 6 5\nare unsymmetrical ethers.\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n7.1 Classify the following as primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols:\nCH\n3\n(i) CH C CH OH (ii) H C CH CH OH\n3 2 2 2\nCH\n3 OH\nCH CH\n3\n(iii) CH CH CH OH (iv)\n3 2 2\nCH\n3\nCH CH C OH\nCH CH CH\n(v) 2 3 (vi) CH\nOH 3\n7.2 Identify allylic alcohols in the above examples.\n77777.....22222 NNNNNooooommmmmeeeeennnnnccccclllllaaaaatttttuuuuurrrrreeeee (a) Alcohols: The common name of an alcohol is derived from the\ncommon name of the alkyl group and adding the word alcohol to it.\nFor example, CH OH is methyl alcohol.\n3\n195 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers\nReprint 2025-26\nAccording to IUPAC system, the name of an alcohol is derived from the\nname of the alkane from which the alcohol is derived, by substituting ‘e’\nof alkane with the suffix ‘ol’. The position of substituents are indicated\nby numerals. For this, the longest carbon chain (parent chain) is\nnumbered starting at the end nearest to the hydroxyl group. The positions\nof the –OH group and other substituents are indicated by using the\nnumbers of carbon atoms to which these are attached. For naming\npolyhydric alcohols, the ‘e’ of alkane is retained and the ending ‘ol’ is\nadded. The number of –OH groups is indicated by adding the\nmultiplicative prefix, di, tri, etc., before ‘ol’. The positions of –OH groups\nare indicated by appropriate locants, e.g., HO–CH –CH –OH is named as\n2 2\nethane–1, 2-diol. Table 7.1 gives common and IUPAC names of a few\nalcohols as examples.\nTable 7.1: Common and IUPAC Names of Some Alcohols\nCompound Common name IUPAC name\nCH – OH Methyl alcohol Methanol\n3\nCH – CH – CH – OH n-Propyl alcohol Propan-1-ol\n3 2 2\nIsopropyl alcohol Propan-2-ol\nCH – CH – CH – CH – OH n-Butyl alcohol Butan-1-ol\n3 2 2 2\nsec-Butyl alcohol Butan-2-ol\nIsobutyl alcohol 2-Methylpropan-1-ol\ntert-Butyl alcohol 2-Methylpropan-2-ol\nHO–H C–CH –OH Ethylene glycol Ethane-1,2-diol\n2 2\nGlycerol Propane -1, 2, 3-triol\nCyclic alcohols are named using the prefix cyclo and considering\nthe —OH group attached to C–1.\nOH\nOH\nCH\n3\nCyclohexanol 2-Methylcyclopentanol\n(b) Phenols: The simplest hydroxy derivative of benzene is phenol.\nIt is its common name and also an accepted IUPAC name. As structure\nof phenol involves a benzene ring, in its substituted compounds the\nterms ortho (1,2- disubstituted), meta (1,3-disubstituted) and para\n(1,4-disubstituted) are often used in the common names.\nChemistry 196\nReprint 2025-26\nOH CH CH CH\n3 3 3\nOH\nOH\nOH\nCommon name Phenol o-Cresol m-Cresol p-Cresol\nIUPAC name Phenol 2-Methylphenol 3-Methylphenol 4-Methylphenol\nDihydroxy derivatives of benzene are known as 1, 2-, 1, 3- and\n1, 4-benzenediol.\nOH OH OH\nOH\nOH\nOH\nCommon name Catechol Resorcinol Hydroquinone or quinol\nIUPAC name Benzene-1,2-diol Benzene-1,3-diol Benzene-1,4-diol\n(c) Ethers: Common names of ethers are derived from the names of alkyl/\naryl groups written as separate words in alphabetical order and adding the\nword ‘ether’ at the end.

It is due to the repulsion between the unshared\nelectron pairs of oxygen. In phenols, the –OH group is attached to sp2\nhybridised carbon of an aromatic ring. The carbon– oxygen bond\nlength (136 pm) in phenol is slightly less than that in methanol. This\nis due to (i) partial double bond character on account of the conjugation\nof unshared electron pair of oxygen with the aromatic ring\n(Section 7.4.4) and (ii) sp2 hybridised state of carbon to which oxygen\nis attached.\nIn ethers, the four electron pairs, i.e., the two bond pairs and two\nlone pairs of electrons on oxygen are arranged approximately in a\ntetrahedral arrangement. The bond angle is slightly greater than the\ntetrahedral angle due to the repulsive interaction between the two\nbulky (–R) groups. The C–O bond length (141 pm) is almost the same\nas in alcohols.\n77777.....44444 AAAAAlllllcccccooooohhhhhooooolllllsssss aaaaannnnnddddd 7.4.1 Preparation of Alcohols\nPPPPPhhhhheeeeennnnnooooolllllsssss Alcohols are prepared by the following methods:\n1. From alkenes\n(i) By acid catalysed hydration: Alkenes react with water in the\npresence of acid as catalyst to form alcohols. In case of\nunsymmetrical alkenes, the addition reaction takes place in\naccordance with Markovnikov’s rule.\nMechanism\nThe mechanism of the reaction involves the following three steps:\nStep 1: Protonation of alkene to form carbocation by electrophilic\nattack of H O+.\n3\nH O + H+ fi H O+\n2 3\nStep 2: Nucleophilic attack of water on carbocation.\nStep 3: Deprotonation to form an alcohol.\n199 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers\nReprint 2025-26\nHydroboration - (ii) By hydroboration–oxidation: Diborane (BH ) reacts with alkenes\n3 2\noxidation was first to give trialkyl boranes as addition product.

For\nhydroxide.\nhis studies on boron\ncontaining organic\ncompounds, Brown\nshared the 1979 Nobel\nprize in Chemistry\nwith G. Wittig.\nThe addition of borane to the double bond takes place in such\na manner that the boron atom gets attached to the sp2 carbon\ncarrying greater number of hydrogen atoms. The alcohol so formed\nlooks as if it has been formed by the addition of water to the\nalkene in a way opposite to the Markovnikov’s rule. In this reaction,\nalcohol is obtained in excellent yield.\n2. From carbonyl compounds\n(i) By reduction of aldehydes and ketones: Aldehydes and ketones\nare reduced to the corresponding alcohols by addition of\nhydrogen in the presence of catalysts (catalytic hydrogenation).\nThe usual catalyst is a finely divided metal such as platinum,\npalladium or nickel. It is also prepared by treating aldehydes\nand ketones with sodium borohydride (NaBH ) or lithium\n4\naluminium hydride (LiAlH ).

From haloarenes\nChlorobenzene is fused with NaOH at 623K and 320 atmospheric\npressure. Phenol is obtained by acidification of sodium phenoxide so\nproduced (Unit 6, Class XII).\n2. From benzenesulphonic acid\nBenzene is sulphonated with oleum and benzene sulphonic acid so\nformed is converted to sodium phenoxide on heating with molten\nsodium hydroxide. Acidification of the sodium salt gives phenol.\n3. From diazonium salts\nA diazonium salt is formed by treating an aromatic primary amine\nwith nitrous acid (NaNO + HCl) at 273-278 K.

The properties of alcohols and phenols are chiefly due\nto the hydroxyl group. The nature of alkyl and aryl groups simply\nmodify these properties.\nBoiling Points\nThe boiling points of alcohols and phenols increase with increase in the\nnumber of carbon atoms (increase in van der Waals forces). In alcohols,\nthe boiling points decrease with increase of branching in carbon chain\n(because of decrease in van der Waals forces with decrease in surface\narea).\nThe –OH group in alcohols and phenols is involved in intermolecular\nhydrogen bonding as shown below:\nIt is interesting to note that boiling points of alcohols and phenols\nare higher in comparison to other classes of compounds, namely\nhydrocarbons, ethers, haloalkanes and haloarenes of comparable\nmolecular masses. For example, ethanol and propane have comparable\nmolecular masses but their boiling points differ widely. The boiling\npoint of methoxymethane is intermediate of the two boiling points.\n203 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers\nReprint 2025-26\nThe high boiling points of alcohols are mainly due to the presence\nof intermolecular hydrogen bonding in them which is lacking in ethers\nand hydrocarbons.\nSolubility\nSolubility of alcohols and phenols in\nwater is due to their ability to form\nhydrogen bonds with water molecules\nas shown. The solubility decreases with\nincrease in size of alkyl/aryl (hydro-\nphobic) groups.

The bond between O–H is broken when alcohols react as\nnucleophiles.\nAlcohols as nucleophiles (i)\n(ii) The bond between C–O is broken when they react as\nelectrophiles. Protonated alcohols react in this manner.\nProtonated alcohols as electrophiles\nBased on the cleavage of O–H and C–O bonds, the reactions\nof alcohols and phenols may be divided into two groups:\nChemistry 204\nReprint 2025-26\n(a) Reactions involving cleavage of O–H bond\n1. Acidity of alcohols and phenols\n(i) Reaction with metals: Alcohols and phenols react with active\nmetals such as sodium, potassium and aluminium to yield\ncorresponding alkoxides/phenoxides and hydrogen.\nIn addition to this, phenols react with aqueous sodium\nhydroxide to form sodium phenoxides.\nOH ONa\n+ NaOH + H O\n2\nSodium phenoxide\nThe above reactions show that alcohols and phenols are\nacidic in nature. In fact, alcohols and phenols are Brönsted\nacids i.e., they can donate a proton to a stronger base (B:).\n(ii) Acidity of alcohols: The acidic character of alcohols is due to\nthe polar nature of O–H bond. An electron-releasing group\n(–CH , –C H ) increases electron density on oxygen tending to\n3 2 5\ndecrease the polarity of O-H bond. This decreases the acid\nstrength. For this reason, the acid strength of alcohols decreases\nin the following order:\n205 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers\nReprint 2025-26\nAlcohols are, however, weaker acids than water. This can be\nillustrated by the reaction of water with an alkoxide.\nThis reaction shows that water is a better proton donor (i.e.,\nstronger acid) than alcohol. Also, in the above reaction, we note\nthat an alkoxide ion is a better proton acceptor than hydroxide\nion, which suggests that alkoxides are stronger bases (sodium\nethoxide is a stronger base than sodium hydroxide).\nAlcohols act as Bronsted bases as well. It is due to the\npresence of unshared electron pairs on oxygen, which makes\nthem proton acceptors.\n(iii) Acidity of phenols: The reactions of phenol with metals (e.g.,\nsodium, aluminium) and sodium hydroxide indicate its acidic\nnature. The hydroxyl group, in phenol is directly attached to\nthe sp2 hybridised carbon of benzene ring which acts as an\nelectron withdrawing group. Due to this, the charge distribution\nin phenol molecule, as depicted in its resonance structures,\ncauses the oxygen of –OH group to be positive.\nThe reaction of phenol with aqueous sodium hydroxide\nindicates that phenols are stronger acids than alcohols and water.\nLet us examine how a compound in which hydroxyl group\nattached to an aromatic ring is more acidic than the one in\nwhich hydroxyl group is attached to an alkyl group.\nThe ionisation of an alcohol and a phenol takes place as follows:\nDue to the higher electronegativity of sp2 hybridised carbon\nof phenol to which –OH is attached, electron density decreases\non oxygen. This increases the polarity of O–H bond and results\nin an increase in ionisation of phenols than that of alcohols.\nNow let us examine the stabilities of alkoxide and phenoxide\nions. In alkoxide ion, the negative charge is localised on oxygen\nwhile in phenoxide ion, the charge is delocalised.\nThe delocalisation of negative charge (structures I-V) makes\nChemistry 206\nReprint 2025-26\nphenoxide ion more stable and favours the ionisation of phenol.\nAlthough there is also charge delocalisation in phenol, its\nresonance structures have charge separation due to which the\nphenol molecule is less stable than phenoxide ion.\nIn substituted phenols, the presence of electron withdrawing\ngroups such as nitro group, enhances the acidic strength of\nphenol. This effect is more pronounced when such a group is\npresent at ortho and para positions. It is due to the effective\ndelocalisation of negative charge in phenoxide ion when\nsubstituent is at ortho or para position. On the other hand,\nelectron releasing groups, such as alkyl groups, in general, do\nnot favour the formation of phenoxide ion resulting in decrease\nin acid strength. Cresols, for example, are less acidic than phenol.\nThe greater the pK a Table 7.3: pK Values of some Phenols and Ethanol\na\nvalue, the weaker the\nacid.\nCompound Formula pK\na\no-Nitrophenol o–O N–C H –OH 7.2\n2 6 4\nm-Nitrophenol m–O N–C H –OH 8.3\n2 6 4\np-Nitrophenol p-O N–C H –OH 7.1\n2 6 4\nPhenol C H –OH 10.0\n6 5\no-Cresol o-CH –C H –OH 10.2\n3 6 4\nm-Cresol m-CH C H –OH 10.1\n3 6 4\np-Cresol p-CH –C H –OH 10.2\n3 6 4\nEthanol C H OH 15.9\n2 5\nFrom the above data, you will note that phenol is million times\nmore acidic than ethanol.\nArrange the following compounds in increasing order of their acid strength: EEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 77777.....44444\nPropan-1-ol, 2,4,6-trinitrophenol, 3-nitrophenol, 3,5-dinitrophenol,\nphenol, 4-methylphenol.\nPropan-1-ol, 4-methylphenol, phenol, 3-nitrophenol, 3,5-dinitrophenol, SSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\n2,4, 6-trinitrophenol.\n2.

Reaction with phosphorus trihalides: Alcohols are converted to\nalkyl bromides by reaction with phosphorus tribromide (Refer\nUnit 6, Class XII).\n3.

To drive the equilibrium\nto the right, ethene is removed as it is formed.\n4. Oxidation: Oxidation of alcohols involves the formation of a carbon-\noxygen double bond with cleavage of an O-H and C-H bonds.\nSuch a cleavage and formation of bonds occur in oxidation\nreactions. These are also known as dehydrogenation reactions as\nthese involve loss of dihydrogen from an alcohol molecule. Depending\non the oxidising agent used, a primary alcohol is oxidised to an\naldehyde which in turn is oxidised to a carboxylic acid.\n209 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers\nReprint 2025-26\nStrong oxidising agents such as acidified potassium\npermanganate are used for getting carboxylic acids from alcohols\ndirectly.

At times the alcoholics, by mistake, drink ethanol,\nmixed with methanol also called denatured alcohol. In the body, methanol is oxidised\nfirst to methanal and then to methanoic acid, which may cause blindness and\ndeath.

Electrophilic aromatic substitution\nIn phenols, the reactions that take place on the aromatic ring are\nelectrophilic substitution reactions (Unit 9, Class XI). The –OH group\nattached to the benzene ring activates it towards electrophilic\nsubstitution. Also, it directs the incoming group to ortho and para\npositions in the ring as these positions become electron rich due to\nthe resonance effect caused by –OH group. The resonance structures\nare shown under acidity of phenols.\nCommon electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions taking place\nin phenol are as follows:\n(i) Nitration: With dilute nitric acid at low temperature (298 K),\nphenol yields a mixture of ortho and para nitrophenols.\nThe ortho and para isomers can be separated by steam\ndistillation. o-Nitrophenol is steam volatile due to intramolecular\nhydrogen bonding while p-nitrophenol is less volatile due to\nintermolecular hydrogen bonding which causes the association\nof molecules.\n2, 4, 6 - Trinitrophenol\nis a strong acid due to\nthe presence of three\nWith concentrated nitric acid, phenol is converted to\nelectron withdrawing\n2,4,6-trinitrophenol.

The preparation of alcohols from alkenes, aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids; You have learnt that substitution of one or more discuss the reactions involved in hydrogen atom(s) from a hydrocarbon by another atom the preparation of phenols from or a group of atoms result in the formation of an entirely haloarenes, benzene sulphonic new compound having altogether different properties acids, diazonium salts and and applications. Alcohols and phenols are formed cumene; when a hydrogen atom in a hydrocarbon, aliphatic and discuss the reactions for aromatic respectively, is replaced by OH group. These preparation of ethers from classes of compounds find wide applications in industry(i) alcohols and(ii) alkyl halides as well as in day - to - day life. For instance, have you and sodium alkoxides / aryloxides; ever noticed that ordinary spirit used for polishing correlate physical properties of wooden furniture is chiefly a compound containing alcohols, phenols and ethers with hydroxyl group, ethanol. The sugar we eat, the cotton their structures; used for fabrics, the paper we use for writing, are all discuss chemical reactions of the three classes of compounds on made up of compounds containing OH groups. Just the basis of their functional think of life without paper; no note - books, books, news - groups. Papers, currency notes, cheques, certificates, etc. The magazines carrying beautiful photographs and interesting stories would disappear from our life. It would have been really a different world. An alcohol contains one or more hydroxyl(OH) group(s) directly attached to carbon atom(s), of an aliphatic system(CH OH) while a phenol contains OH 3 group(s) directly attached to carbon atom(s) of an aromatic system(C H OH). 6 5 The substitution of a hydrogen atom in a hydrocarbon by an alkoxy or aryloxy group(R O / Ar O) yields another class of compounds known as ethers, for example, CH OCH(dimethyl ether). You 3 3 may also visualise ethers as compounds formed by Reprint 2025 - 26 substituting the hydrogen atom of hydroxyl group of an alcohol or phenol by an alkyl or aryl group. In this unit, we shall discuss the chemistry of three classes of compounds, namely alcohols, phenols and ethers. 77777. 11111 Clasification The classification of compounds makes their study systematic and hence simpler. Therefore, let us first learn how are alcohols, phenols and ethers classified? 7. 1. 1 Alcohols Alcohols and phenols may be classified as mono, di, tri - or Mono, Di, polyhydric compounds depending on whether they contain one, two, Tri or three or many hydroxyl groups respectively in their structures as Polyhydric given below: alcohols Monohydric Dihydric Trihydric Monohydric alcohols may be further classified according to the hybridisation of the carbon atom to which the hydroxyl group is attached.(i) Compounds containing C Ohbond: In this class of alcohols, sp3 the OH group is attached to an sp3 hybridised carbon atom of an alkyl group. They are further classified as follows: Primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols: In these three types of alcohols, the OH group is attached to primary, secondary and tertiary carbon atom, respectively as depicted below: Allylic alcohols: In these alcohols, the OH group is attached to a sp3 hybridised carbon adjacent to the carbon - carbon double bond, that is to an allylic carbon. For example Benzylic alcohols: In these alcohols, the OH group is attached to a sp3 hybridised carbon atom next to an aromatic ring. For example. Chemistry 194 Reprint 2025 - 26 Allylic and benzylic alcohols may be primary, secondary or tertiary.(ii) Compounds containing C OH bond: These alcohols contain sp2 OH group bonded to a carbon - carbon double bond, i. e., to a vinylic carbon or to an aryl carbon. These alcohols are also known as vinylic alcohols. Vinylic alcohol: CH = CH OH 2 7. 1. 2 Phenols Mono, Di and trihydric phenols Monohydric 7. 1. 3 Ethers Ethers are classified as simple or symmetrical, if the alkyl or aryl groups attached to the oxygen atom are the same, and mixed or unsymmetrical, if the two groups are different. Diethyl ether, C H OC H, is a symmetrical ether whereas C H OCH and C H OC H 2 5 2 5 2 5 3 2 5 6 5 are unsymmetrical ethers. Intext Questions 7. 1 Classify the following as primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols: CH 3(i) CH C CH OH(ii) H C CH CH OH 3 2 2 2 CH 3 OH CH CH 3(i) CH CH CH OH(iv) 3 2 2 CH 3 CH CH C OH CH CH CH(v) 2 3(vi) CH OH 3 7. 2 Identify allylic alcohols in the above examples. 77777. 22222 Nomenclature(a) Alcohols: The common name of an alcohol is derived from the common name of the alkyl group and adding the word alcohol to it. For example, CH OH is methyl alcohol. 3 195 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers Reprint 2025 - 26 According to IUPAC system, the name of an alcohol is derived from the name of the alkane from which the alcohol is derived, by substituting e of alkane with the suffix ol. The position of substituents are indicated by numerals. For this, the longest carbon chain(parent chain) is numbered starting at the end nearest to the hydroxyl group. The positions of the OH group and other substituents are indicated by using the numbers of carbon atoms to which these are attached. For naming polyhydric alcohols, the e of alkane is retained and the ending ol is added. The number of OH groups is indicated by adding the multiplicative prefix, di, tri, etc., before ol. The positions of OH groups are indicated by appropriate locants, e. g., HO CH CH OH is named as 2 2 ethane 1, 2 - diol. Table 7. 1 gives common and IUPAC names of a few alcohols as examples. Table 7. 1: Common and IUPAC Names of Some Alcohols Compound Common name IUPAC name CH OH Methyl alcohol Methanol 3 CH CH CH OH n - Propyl alcohol Propan - 1 - ol 3 2 2 Isopropyl alcohol Propan - 2 - ol CH CH CH CH OH n - Butyl alcohol Butan - 1 - ol 3 2 2 2 sec - Butyl alcohol Butan - 2 - ol Isobutyl alcohol 2 - Methylpropan - 1 - ol tert - Butyl alcohol 2 - Methylpropan - 2 - ol HO H C CH OH Ethylene glycol Ethane - 1, 2 - diol 2 2 Glycerol Propane - 1, 2, 3 - triol Cyclic alcohols are named using the prefix cyclo and considering the OH group attached to C 1. OH OH CH 3 Cyclohexanol 2 - Methylcyclopentanol(b) Phenols: The simplest hydroxy derivative of benzene is phenol. It is its common name and also an accepted IUPAC name. As structure of phenol involves a benzene ring, in its substituted compounds the terms ortho(1, 2 - disubstituted), meta(1, 3 - disubstituted) and para(1, 4 - disubstituted) are often used in the common names. Chemistry 196 Reprint 2025 - 26 OH CH CH CH 3 3 3 OH OH OH Common name Phenol o - Cresol m - Cresol p - Cresol IUPAC name Phenol 2 - Methylphenol 3 - Methylphenol 4 - Methylphenol Dihydroxy derivatives of benzene are known as 1, 2 -, 1, 3 - and 1, 4 - benzenediol. OH OH OH OH OH OH Common name Catechol Resorcinol Hydroquinone or quinol IUPAC name Benzene - 1, 2 - diol Benzene - 1, 3 - diol Benzene - 1, 4 - diol(c) Ethers: Common names of ethers are derived from the names of alkyl / aryl groups written as separate words in alphabetical order and adding the word ether at the end. For example, CH OC H is ethylmethyl ether. 3 2 5 Table 7. 2: Common and IUPAC Names of Some Ethers Compound Common name IUPAC name CH OCH Dimethyl ether Methoxymethane 3 3 C H OC H Diethyl ether Ethoxyethane 2 5 2 5 CH OCH CH CH Methyl n - propyl ether 1 - Methoxypropane 3 2 2 3 C H OCH Methyl phenyl ether Methoxybenzene 6 5 3(Anisole)(Anisole) C H OCH CH Ethyl phenyl ether Ethoxybenzene 6 5 2 3(Phenetole) C H O(CH) CH Heptyl phenyl ether 1 - Phenoxyheptane 6 5 2 6 3 CHO CH CH Methyl isopropyl ether 2 - Methoxypropane 3 3 CH 3 Phenyl isopentyl ether 3 - Methylbutoxybenzene CH O CH CH OCH 1, 2 - Dimethoxyethane 3 2 2 3 2 - Ethoxy - - 1, 1 - dimethylcyclohexane 197 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers Reprint 2025 - 26 If both the alkyl groups are the same, the prefix di is added before the alkyl group. For example, C H OC H is diethyl ether. 2 5 2 5 According to IUPAC system of nomenclature, ethers are regarded as hydrocarbon derivatives in which a hydrogen atom is replaced by an OR or Oar group, where R and Ar represent alkyl and aryl groups, respectively. The larger(R) group is chosen as the parent hydrocarbon. The names of a few ethers are given as examples in Table 7. 2. Example 77777. 11111 Give IUPAC names of the following compounds:(i() i) CH CH CH CH CH OH(i(ii) i) CH CH O CH CH 3 2 3 2 3 Cl CH CH CH 3 3 3 OH NO 2(i) H 3 C CH 3(iv) OC 2 H 5 Solution(i) 4 - Chloro - 2, 3 - dimethylpentan - 1 - ol(ii) 2 - Ethoxypropane(i) 2, 6 - Dimethylphenol(iv) 1 - Ethoxy - 2 - nitrocyclohexane Intext Question 7. 3 Name the following compounds according to IUPAC system.(i)(ii)(i)(iv)(v) 77777. 33333 Structures of In alcohols, the oxygen of the OH group is attached to carbon by a Functional sigma(s) bond formed by the overlap of a sp3 hybridised orbital of carbon with a sp3 hybridised orbital of oxygen. Fig. 7. 1 depicts Groups structural aspects of methanol, phenol and methoxymethane. Fig. 7. 1: Structures of methanol, phenol and methoxymethane Chemistry 198 Reprint 2025 - 26 The bond angle in alcohols is slightly less than the tetrahedral angle(109 ° - 28 ¢). It is due to the repulsion between the unshared electron pairs of oxygen. In phenols, the OH group is attached to sp2 hybridised carbon of an aromatic ring. The carbon oxygen bond length(136 pm) in phenol is slightly less than that in methanol. This is due to(i) partial double bond character on account of the conjugation of unshared electron pair of oxygen with the aromatic ring(Section 7. 4. 4) and(ii) sp2 hybridised state of carbon to which oxygen is attached. In ethers, the four electron pairs, i. e., the two bond pairs and two lone pairs of electrons on oxygen are arranged approximately in a tetrahedral arrangement. The bond angle is slightly greater than the tetrahedral angle due to the repulsive interaction between the two bulky(R) groups. The C O bond length(141 pm) is almost the same as in alcohols. 77777. 44444 Alcohols and 7. 4. 1 Preparation of Alcohols Phenols Alcohols are prepared by the following methods: 1. From alkenes(i) By acid catalysed hydration: Alkenes react with water in the presence of acid as catalyst to form alcohols. In case of unsymmetrical alkenes, the addition reaction takes place in accordance with Markovnikov s rule. Mechanism The mechanism of the reaction involves the following three steps: Step 1: Protonation of alkene to form carbocation by electrophilic attack of H O +. 3 H O + H + fi H O + 2 3 Step 2: Nucleophilic attack of water on carbocation. Step 3: Deprotonation to form an alcohol. 199 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers Reprint 2025 - 26 Hydroboration -(ii) By hydroboration oxidation: Diborane(BH) reacts with alkenes 3 2 oxidation was first to give trialkyl boranes as addition product. This is oxidised to reported by H. C. Alcohol by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of aqueous sodium Brown in 1959. For hydroxide. His studies on boron containing organic compounds, Brown shared the 1979 Nobel prize in Chemistry with G. Wittig. The addition of borane to the double bond takes place in such a manner that the boron atom gets attached to the sp2 carbon carrying greater number of hydrogen atoms. The alcohol so formed looks as if it has been formed by the addition of water to the alkene in a way opposite to the Markovnikov s rule. In this reaction, alcohol is obtained in excellent yield. 2. From carbonyl compounds(i) By reduction of aldehydes and ketones: Aldehydes and ketones are reduced to the corresponding alcohols by addition of hydrogen in the presence of catalysts(catalytic hydrogenation). The usual catalyst is a finely divided metal such as platinum, palladium or nickel. It is also prepared by treating aldehydes and ketones with sodium borohydride(NaBH) or lithium 4 aluminium hydride(Lialh). Aldehydes yield primary alcohols 4 whereas ketones give secondary alcohols. The numbers in front(ii) By reduction of carboxylic acids and esters: Carboxylic acids of the reagents along are reduced to primary alcohols in excellent yields by lithium the arrow indicate aluminium hydride, a strong reducing agent. That the second reagent is added only(i) Lialh 4 when the reaction RCOOH RCH OH 2 with first is complete.(ii) HO 2 However, Lialh is an expensive reagent, and therefore, used 4 for preparing special chemicals only. Commercially, acids are reduced to alcohols by converting them to the esters(Section 7. 4. 4), followed by their reduction using hydrogen in the presence of catalyst(catalytic hydrogenation). R ' OH H + Chemistry 200 Reprint 2025 - 26 3. From Grignard reagents Alcohols are produced by the reaction of Grignard reagents(Unit 6, Class XII) with aldehydes and ketones. The first step of the reaction is the nucleophilic addition of Grignard reagent to the carbonyl group to form an adduct. Hydrolysis of the adduct yields an alcohol..(i).(ii) The reaction of The overall reactions using different aldehydes and ketones are as Grignard reagents follows: with methanal produces a primary alcohol, with other aldehydes, secondary alcohols and with ketones, tertiary alcohols. You will notice that the reaction produces a primary alcohol with methanal, a secondary alcohol with other aldehydes and tertiary alcohol with ketones. Give the structures and IUPAC names of the products expected from Example 77777. 22222 the following reactions:(a) Catalytic reduction of butanal.(b) Hydration of propene in the presence of dilute sulphuric acid.(c) Reaction of propanone with methylmagnesium bromide followed by hydrolysis. Solution(a)(b)(c) 7. 4. 2 Preparation Phenol, also known as carbolic acid, was first isolated in the early of Phenols nineteenth century from coal tar. Nowadays, phenol is commercially produced synthetically. In the laboratory, phenols are prepared from benzene derivatives by any of the following methods: 201 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers Reprint 2025 - 26 1. From haloarenes Chlorobenzene is fused with NaOH at 623K and 320 atmospheric pressure. Phenol is obtained by acidification of sodium phenoxide so produced(Unit 6, Class XII). 2. From benzenesulphonic acid Benzene is sulphonated with oleum and benzene sulphonic acid so formed is converted to sodium phenoxide on heating with molten sodium hydroxide. Acidification of the sodium salt gives phenol. 3. From diazonium salts A diazonium salt is formed by treating an aromatic primary amine with nitrous acid(NaNO + Hcl) at 273 - 278 K. Diazonium salts are 2 hydrolysed to phenols by warming with water or by treating with dilute acids(Unit 9, Class XII). + NH N Cl OH 2 2 NaNO2 H O 2 + N + Hcl 2 + Hcl Warm Aniline Benzene diazonium chloride Most of the worldwide 4. From cumene production of phenol is from cumene. Phenol is manufactured from the hydrocarbon, cumene. Cumene(isopropylbenzene) is oxidised in the presence of air to cumene hydroperoxide. It is converted to phenol and acetone by treating it with dilute acid. Acetone, a by - product of this reaction, is also obtained in large quantities by this method. Chemistry 202 Reprint 2025 - 26 Intext Questions 7. 4 Show how are the following alcohols prepared by the reaction of a suitable Grignard reagent on methanal? 7. 5 Write structures of the products of the following reactions:(i)(ii)(i) 7. 4. 3 Physical Alcohols and phenols consist of two parts, an alkyl / aryl group and a Properties hydroxyl group. The properties of alcohols and phenols are chiefly due to the hydroxyl group. The nature of alkyl and aryl groups simply modify these properties. Boiling Points The boiling points of alcohols and phenols increase with increase in the number of carbon atoms(increase in van der Waals forces). In alcohols, the boiling points decrease with increase of branching in carbon chain(because of decrease in van der Waals forces with decrease in surface area). The OH group in alcohols and phenols is involved in intermolecular hydrogen bonding as shown below: It is interesting to note that boiling points of alcohols and phenols are higher in comparison to other classes of compounds, namely hydrocarbons, ethers, haloalkanes and haloarenes of comparable molecular masses. For example, ethanol and propane have comparable molecular masses but their boiling points differ widely. The boiling point of methoxymethane is intermediate of the two boiling points. 203 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers Reprint 2025 - 26 The high boiling points of alcohols are mainly due to the presence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding in them which is lacking in ethers and hydrocarbons. Solubility Solubility of alcohols and phenols in water is due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules as shown. The solubility decreases with increase in size of alkyl / aryl(hydro - phobic) groups. Several of the lower molecular mass alcohols are miscible with water in all proportions. Example 77777. 33333 Arrange the following sets of compounds in order of their increasing boiling points:(a) Pentan - 1 - ol, butan - 1 - ol, butan - 2 - ol, ethanol, propan - 1 - ol, methanol.(b) Pentan - 1 - ol, n - butane, pentanal, ethoxyethane. Solution(a) Methanol, ethanol, propan - 1 - ol, butan - 2 - ol, butan - 1 - ol, pentan - 1 - ol.(b) n - Butane, ethoxyethane, pentanal and pentan - 1 - ol. 7. 4. 4 Chemical Alcohols are versatile compounds. They react both as nucleophiles and Reactions electrophiles. The bond between O H is broken when alcohols react as nucleophiles. Alcohols as nucleophiles(i)(ii) The bond between C O is broken when they react as electrophiles. Protonated alcohols react in this manner. Protonated alcohols as electrophiles Based on the cleavage of O H and C O bonds, the reactions of alcohols and phenols may be divided into two groups: Chemistry 204 Reprint 2025 - 26(a) Reactions involving cleavage of O H bond 1. Acidity of alcohols and phenols(i) Reaction with metals: Alcohols and phenols react with active metals such as sodium, potassium and aluminium to yield corresponding alkoxides / phenoxides and hydrogen. In addition to this, phenols react with aqueous sodium hydroxide to form sodium phenoxides. OH Ona + NaOH + H O 2 Sodium phenoxide The above reactions show that alcohols and phenols are acidic in nature. In fact, alcohols and phenols are Brönsted acids i. e., they can donate a proton to a stronger base(B:).(ii) Acidity of alcohols: The acidic character of alcohols is due to the polar nature of O H bond. An electron - releasing group(CH, C H) increases electron density on oxygen tending to 3 2 5 decrease the polarity of O - H bond. This decreases the acid strength. For this reason, the acid strength of alcohols decreases in the following order: 205 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers Reprint 2025 - 26 Alcohols are, however, weaker acids than water. This can be illustrated by the reaction of water with an alkoxide. This reaction shows that water is a better proton donor(i. e., stronger acid) than alcohol. Also, in the above reaction, we note that an alkoxide ion is a better proton acceptor than hydroxide ion, which suggests that alkoxides are stronger bases(sodium ethoxide is a stronger base than sodium hydroxide). Alcohols act as Bronsted bases as well. It is due to the presence of unshared electron pairs on oxygen, which makes them proton acceptors.(i) Acidity of phenols: The reactions of phenol with metals(e. g., sodium, aluminium) and sodium hydroxide indicate its acidic nature. The hydroxyl group, in phenol is directly attached to the sp2 hybridised carbon of benzene ring which acts as an electron withdrawing group. Due to this, the charge distribution in phenol molecule, as depicted in its resonance structures, causes the oxygen of OH group to be positive. The reaction of phenol with aqueous sodium hydroxide indicates that phenols are stronger acids than alcohols and water. Let us examine how a compound in which hydroxyl group attached to an aromatic ring is more acidic than the one in which hydroxyl group is attached to an alkyl group. The ionisation of an alcohol and a phenol takes place as follows: Due to the higher electronegativity of sp2 hybridised carbon of phenol to which OH is attached, electron density decreases on oxygen. This increases the polarity of O H bond and results in an increase in ionisation of phenols than that of alcohols. Now let us examine the stabilities of alkoxide and phenoxide ions. In alkoxide ion, the negative charge is localised on oxygen while in phenoxide ion, the charge is delocalised. The delocalisation of negative charge(structures I - V) makes Chemistry 206 Reprint 2025 - 26 phenoxide ion more stable and favours the ionisation of phenol. Although there is also charge delocalisation in phenol, its resonance structures have charge separation due to which the phenol molecule is less stable than phenoxide ion. In substituted phenols, the presence of electron withdrawing groups such as nitro group, enhances the acidic strength of phenol. This effect is more pronounced when such a group is present at ortho and para positions. It is due to the effective delocalisation of negative charge in phenoxide ion when substituent is at ortho or para position. On the other hand, electron releasing groups, such as alkyl groups, in general, do not favour the formation of phenoxide ion resulting in decrease in acid strength. Cresols, for example, are less acidic than phenol. The greater the Pk a Table 7. 3: Pk Values of some Phenols and Ethanol a value, the weaker the acid.

The reaction is reversible, and therefore, water is removed as inflammatory and soon as it is formed. The reaction with acid chloride is carried out in antipyretic properties. The presence of a base(pyridine) so as to neutralise Hcl which is formed during the reaction. It shifts the equilibrium to the right hand side. The introduction of acetyl(CH CO) group in alcohols or 3 phenols is known as acetylation. Acetylation of salicylic acid produces aspirin.(b) Reactions involving cleavage of carbon oxygen(C O) bond in alcohols The reactions involving cleavage of C O bond take place only in alcohols. Phenols show this type of reaction only with zinc. 1. Reaction with hydrogen halides: Alcohols react with hydrogen halides to form alkyl halides(Refer Unit 6, Class XII). ROH + HX fi R X + H O 2 The difference in reactivity of three classes of alcohols with Hcl distinguishes them from one another(Lucas test). Alcohols are soluble in Lucas reagent(conc. Hcl and Zncl) while their halides are immiscible 2 and produce turbidity in solution. In case of tertiary alcohols, turbidity is produced immediately as they form the halides easily. Primary alcohols do not produce turbidity at room temperature. 2. Reaction with phosphorus trihalides: Alcohols are converted to alkyl bromides by reaction with phosphorus tribromide(Refer Unit 6, Class XII). 3. Dehydration: Alcohols undergo dehydration(removal of a molecule of water) to form alkenes on treating with a protic acid e. g., concentrated H SO or H PO, or catalysts such as anhydrous zinc 2 4 3 4 chloride or alumina. Ethanol undergoes dehydration by heating it with concentrated H SO at 443 K. 2 4 Chemistry 208 Reprint 2025 - 26 Secondary and tertiary alcohols are dehydrated under milder conditions. For example Thus, the relative ease of dehydration of alcohols follows the following order: Tertiary > Secondary > Primary The mechanism of dehydration of ethanol involves the following steps: Tertiary carbocations Mechanism are more stable and Step 1: Formation of protonated alcohol. Therefore are easier to form than secondary and primary carbocations; tertiary alcohols are the easiest to dehydrate. Step 2: Formation of carbocation: It is the slowest step and hence, the rate determining step of the reaction. Step 3: Formation of ethene by elimination of a proton. The acid used in step 1 is released in step 3. To drive the equilibrium to the right, ethene is removed as it is formed. 4. Oxidation: Oxidation of alcohols involves the formation of a carbon - oxygen double bond with cleavage of an O - H and C - H bonds. Such a cleavage and formation of bonds occur in oxidation reactions. These are also known as dehydrogenation reactions as these involve loss of dihydrogen from an alcohol molecule. Depending on the oxidising agent used, a primary alcohol is oxidised to an aldehyde which in turn is oxidised to a carboxylic acid. 209 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers Reprint 2025 - 26 Strong oxidising agents such as acidified potassium permanganate are used for getting carboxylic acids from alcohols directly. Cro in anhydrous medium is used as the oxidising agent 3 for the isolation of aldehydes. Cro RCH OH 3 RCHO 2 A better reagent for oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes in good yield is pyridinium chlorochromate(PCC), a complex of chromium trioxide with pyridine and Hcl. PCC CH CH CH CH OH CH CH CH CHO 3 2 3 Secondary alcohols are oxidised to ketones by chromic anhyride(Cro). 3 Tertiary alcohols do not undergo oxidation reaction. Under strong reaction conditions such as strong oxidising agents(KMnO) and 4 elevated temperatures, cleavage of various C - C bonds takes place and a mixture of carboxylic acids containing lesser number of carbon atoms is formed. When the vapours of a primary or a secondary alcohol are passed over heated copper at 573 K, dehydrogenation takes place and an aldehyde or a ketone is formed while tertiary alcohols undergo dehydration. Biological oxidation of methanol and ethanol in the body produces the corresponding aldehyde followed by the acid. At times the alcoholics, by mistake, drink ethanol, mixed with methanol also called denatured alcohol. In the body, methanol is oxidised first to methanal and then to methanoic acid, which may cause blindness and death. A methanol poisoned patient is treated by giving intravenous infusions of diluted ethanol. The enzyme responsible for oxidation of aldehyde(HCHO) to acid is swamped allowing time for kidneys to excrete methanol.(c) Reactions of phenols Following reactions are shown by phenols only. Chemistry 210 Reprint 2025 - 26 1. Electrophilic aromatic substitution In phenols, the reactions that take place on the aromatic ring are electrophilic substitution reactions(Unit 9, Class XI). The OH group attached to the benzene ring activates it towards electrophilic substitution. Also, it directs the incoming group to ortho and para positions in the ring as these positions become electron rich due to the resonance effect caused by OH group. The resonance structures are shown under acidity of phenols. Common electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions taking place in phenol are as follows:(i) Nitration: With dilute nitric acid at low temperature(298 K), phenol yields a mixture of ortho and para nitrophenols. The ortho and para isomers can be separated by steam distillation. O - Nitrophenol is steam volatile due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding while p - nitrophenol is less volatile due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding which causes the association of molecules. 2, 4, 6 - Trinitrophenol is a strong acid due to the presence of three With concentrated nitric acid, phenol is converted to electron withdrawing 2, 4, 6 - trinitrophenol. The product is commonly known as picric NO groups which 2 acid. The yield of the reaction product is poor. Facilitate the release of hydrogen ion. Nowadays picric acid is prepared by treating phenol first with concentrated sulphuric acid which converts it to phenol - 2, 4 - disulphonic acid, and then with concentrated nitric acid to get 2, 4, 6 - trinitrophenol. Can you write the equations of the reactions involved? 211 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers Reprint 2025 - 26(ii) Halogenation: On treating phenol with bromine, different reaction products are formed under different experimental conditions.(a) When the reaction is carried out in solvents of low polarity such as CHCl or CS and at low temperature, 3 2 monobromophenols are formed. The usual halogenation of benzene takes place in the presence of a Lewis acid, such as Febr(Unit 6, Class XII), 3 which polarises the halogen molecule. In case of phenol, the polarisation of bromine molecule takes place even in the absence of Lewis acid. It is due to the highly activating effect of OH group attached to the benzene ring.(b) When phenol is treated with bromine water, 2, 4, 6 - tribromophenol is formed as white precipitate. Example 77777. 55555 Write the structures of the major products expected from the following reactions:(a) Mononitration of 3 - methylphenol(b) Dinitration of 3 - methylphenol(c) Mononitration of phenyl methanoate. Solution The combined influence of OH and CH groups determine the 3 position of the incoming group. 2. Kolbe s reaction Phenoxide ion generated by treating phenol with sodium hydroxide is even more reactive than phenol towards electrophilic aromatic substitution. Hence, it undergoes electrophilic substitution with carbon dioxide, a weak electrophile. Ortho hydroxybenzoic acid is formed as the main reaction product. Chemistry 212 Reprint 2025 - 26 3. Reimer - Tiemann reaction On treating phenol with chloroform in the presence of sodium hydroxide, a CHO group is introduced at ortho position of benzene ring. This reaction is known as Reimer - Tiemann reaction. The intermediate substituted benzal chloride is hydrolysed in the presence of alkali to produce salicylaldehyde. 4. Reaction of phenol with zinc dust Phenol is converted to benzene on heating with zinc dust. 5. Oxidation Oxidation of phenol with chromic acid produces a conjugated diketone known as benzoquinone. In the presence of air, phenols are slowly oxidised to dark coloured mixtures containing quinones.

Comercialy 1. Methanol Important Methanol, CH OH, also known as wood spirit, was produced by Alcohols 3 destructive distillation of wood. Today, most of the methanol is produced by catalytic hydrogenation of carbon monoxide at high pressure and temperature and in the presence of Zno Cr O 2 3 catalyst. Methanol is a colourless liquid and boils at 337 K. It is highly poisonous in nature. Ingestion of even small quantities of methanol can cause blindness and large quantities causes even death. Methanol is used as a solvent in paints, varnishes and chiefly for making formaldehyde. 2. Ethanol Ethanol, C H OH, is obtained commercially by fermentation, the 2 5 oldest method is from sugars. The sugar in molasses, sugarcane or fruits such as grapes is converted to glucose and fructose,(both of which have the formula C H O), in the presence of an enzyme, 6 12 6 invertase. Glucose and fructose undergo fermentation in the presence of another enzyme, zymase, which is found in yeast. In wine making, grapes are the source of sugars and yeast. As Ingestion of ethanol acts grapes ripen, the quantity of sugar increases and yeast grows on the on the central nervous outer skin. When grapes are crushed, sugar and the enzyme come in system. In moderate contact and fermentation starts. Fermentation takes place in amounts, it affects anaerobic conditions i. e. In absence of air. Carbon dioxide is released judgment and lowers during fermentation. Inhibitions. Higher The action of zymase is inhibited once the percentage of alcohol concentrations cause formed exceeds 14 percent. If air gets into fermentation mixture, the nausea and loss of consciousness. Even at oxygen of air oxidises ethanol to ethanoic acid which in turn destroys higher concentrations, the taste of alcoholic drinks. It interferes with Ethanol is a colourless liquid with boiling point 351 K. It is used spontaneous respiration as a solvent in paint industry and in the preparation of a number of and can be fatal. Carbon compounds. The commercial alcohol is made unfit for drinking by mixing in it some copper sulphate(to give it a colour) and pyridine(a foul smelling liquid). It is known as denaturation of alcohol. Nowadays, large quantities of ethanol are obtained by hydration of ethene(Section 7. 4). Chemistry 214 Reprint 2025 - 26 77777. 66666 Ethers 7. 6. 1 Preparation 1. By dehydration of alcohols of Ethers Alcohols undergo dehydration in the presence of protic acids(H SO, H PO). The formation of the reaction product, alkene or ether 2 4 3 4 depends on the reaction conditions. For example, ethanol is dehydrated to ethene in the presence of sulphuric acid at 443 K. At 413 K, ethoxyethane is the main product. Diethyl ether has been used widely as an inhalation anaesthetic. But due to its slow effect and an unpleasant recovery The formation of ether is a nucleophilic bimolecular reaction(S 2) N period, it has been involving the attack of alcohol molecule on a protonated alcohol, as replaced, as an indicated below: anaesthetic, by other compounds. Acidic dehydration of alcohols, to give an alkene is also associated with substitution reaction to give an ether. The method is suitable for the preparation of ethers having primary alkyl groups only. The alkyl group should be unhindered and the temperature be kept low. Otherwise the reaction favours the formation of alkene. The reaction follows S 1 pathway when the alcohol N is secondary or tertiary about which you will learn in higher classes. However, the dehydration of secondary and tertiary alcohols to give corresponding ethers is unsuccessful as elimination competes over substitution and as a consequence, alkenes are easily formed. Can you explain why is bimolecular dehydration not appropriate for the preparation of ethyl methyl ether? 2. Williamson synthesis It is an important laboratory method for the preparation of Alexander William symmetrical and unsymmetrical ethers. In this method, an alkyl Williamson(1824 1904) halide is allowed to react with sodium alkoxide. Was born in London of Scottish parents. In R X + R O N + a R O R + Na X 1849, he became Professor of Chemistry Ethers containing substituted alkyl groups(secondary or tertiary) at University College, may also be prepared by this method. The reaction involves S 2 attack N London. Of an alkoxide ion on primary alkyl halide. 215 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers Reprint 2025 - 26 Ona + CH Br 3 Better results are obtained if the alkyl halide is primary. In case of secondary and tertiary alkyl halides, elimination competes over substitution. If a tertiary alkyl halide is used, an alkene is the only reaction product and no ether is formed. For example, the reaction of CH Ona with(CH) C Br gives exclusively 2 - methylpropene. 3 3 3 It is because alkoxides are not only nucleophiles but strong bases as well. They react with alkyl halides leading to elimination reactions. Example 77777. 66666 The following is not an appropriate reaction for the preparation of t - butyl ethyl ether.(i) What would be the major product of this reaction?(ii) Write a suitable reaction for the preparation of t - butylethyl ether. Solution(i) The major product of the given reaction is 2 - methylprop - 1 - ene. It is because sodium ethoxide is a strong nucleophile as well as a strong base. Thus elimination reaction predominates over substitution.(ii) Phenols are also converted to ethers by this method. In this, phenol is used as the phenoxide moiety. Chemistry 216 Reprint 2025 - 26 7. 6. 2 Physical The C - O bonds in ethers are polar and thus, ethers have a net dipole Properties moment. The weak polarity of ethers do not appreciably affect their boiling points which are comparable to those of the alkanes of comparable molecular masses but are much lower than the boiling points of alcohols as shown in the following cases: Formula CH(CH) CH C H - O - C H CH(CH) - OH 3 23 3 2 5 2 5 3 23 n - Pentane Ethoxyethane Butan - 1 - ol b. p. / K 309. 1 307. 6 390 The large difference in boiling points of alcohols and ethers is due to the presence of hydrogen bonding in alcohols. The miscibility of ethers with water resembles those of alcohols of the same molecular mass. Both ethoxyethane and butan - 1 - ol are miscible to almost the same extent i. e., 7. 5 and 9 g per 100 Ml water, respectively while pentane is essentially immiscible with water. Can you explain this observation? This is due to the fact that just like alcohols, oxygen of ether can also form hydrogen bonds with water molecule as shown: 1. Cleavage of C O bond in ethers 7. 6. 3 Chemical Reactions Ethers are the least reactive of the functional groups. The cleavage of C - O bond in ethers takes place under drastic conditions with excess of hydrogen halides. The reaction of dialkyl ether gives two alkyl halide molecules. Alkyl aryl ethers are cleaved at the alkyl - oxygen bond due to the more stable aryl - oxygen bond. The reaction yields phenol and alkyl halide. Ethers with two different alkyl groups are also cleaved in the same manner. The order of reactivity of hydrogen halides is as follows: HI > Hbr > Hcl. The cleavage of ethers takes place with concentrated HI or Hbr at high temperature. 217 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers Reprint 2025 - 26 Mechanism The reaction of an ether with concentrated HI starts with protonation of ether molecule. Step 1: The reaction takes place with Hbr or HI because these reagents are sufficiently acidic. Step 2: Iodide is a good nucleophile. It attacks the least substituted carbon of the oxonium ion formed in step 1 and displaces an alcohol molecule by S2 mechanism. N Thus, in the cleavage of mixed ethers with two different alkyl groups, the alcohol and alkyl iodide formed, depend on the nature of alkyl groups. When primary or secondary alkyl groups are present, it is the lower alkyl group that forms alkyl iodide(S 2 reaction). N When HI is in excess and the reaction is carried out at high temperature, ethanol reacts with another molecule of HI and is converted to ethyl iodide. Step 3: However, when one of the alkyl group is a tertiary group, the halide formed is a tertiary halide. CH 3 CH 3 CH C O CH + HI CHOH + CH C I 3 3 3 3 CH CH 3 3 It is because in step 2 of the reaction, the departure of leaving group(HO CH) creates a more stable carbocation[(CH) C +], and the reaction 3 33 follows S 1 mechanism. N In case of anisole, methylphenyl CH CH 3 3 + slow + oxonium ion, is CH C O CH CH C + CHOH 3 3 3 3 H CH 3 CH 3 formed by protonation of ether. The bond between O CH is weaker 3 CH CH 3 3 than the bond between O C H 6 5 CH C + + I fast CH C I because the carbon of phenyl 3 3 group is sp2 hybridised and there CH CH is a partial double bond character. 3 3 Chemistry 218 Reprint 2025 - 26 Therefore the attack by I ion breaks O CH bond to form CH I. Phenols 3 3 do not react further to give halides because the sp2 hybridised carbon of phenol cannot undergo nucleophilic substitution reaction needed for conversion to the halide. Give the major products that are formed by heating each of the following Example 77777. 77777 ethers with HI.(i)(ii)(i)(i)(ii) Solution(i) 2. Electrophilic substitution The alkoxy group(- OR) is ortho, para directing and activates the aromatic ring towards electrophilic substitution in the same way as in phenol.(i) Halogenation: Phenylalkyl ethers undergo usual halogenation in the benzene ring, e. g., anisole undergoes bromination with bromine in ethanoic acid even in the absence of iron(I) bromide catalyst. It is due to the activation of benzene ring by the methoxy group. Para isomer is obtained in 90 % yield. 219 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers Reprint 2025 - 26(ii) Friedel - Crafts reaction: Anisole undergoes Friedel - Crafts reaction, i. e., the alkyl and acyl groups are introduced at ortho and para positions by reaction with alkyl halide and acyl halide in the presence of anhydrous aluminium chloride(a Lewis acid) as catalyst.(i) Nitration: Anisole reacts with a mixture of concentrated sulphuric and nitric acids to yield a mixture of ortho and para nitroanisole. Intext Questions 7. 10 Write the reactions of Williamson synthesis of 2 - ethoxy - 3 - methylpentane starting from ethanol and 3 - methylpentan - 2 - ol. 7. 11 Which of the following is an appropriate set of reactants for the preparation of 1 - methoxy - 4 - nitrobenzene and why?(i)(ii) Chemistry 220 Reprint 2025 - 26 7. 12 Predict the products of the following reactions:(i) CH - CH - CH - O C + H Hfibr 3 2 2 3(ii)(i)(iv)(CH) C - OC(cid: 190) H(cid: 190)(cid: 190) fi HI 3 3 2 5 Sumary Alcohols and phenols are classified(i) on the basis of the number of hydroxyl groups and(ii) according to the hybridisation of the carbon atom, sp3 or sp2 to which the OH group is attached. Ethers are classified on the basis of groups attached to the oxygen atom. Alcohols may be prepared(1) by hydration of alkenes(i) in presence of an acid and(ii) by hydroboration - oxidation reaction(2) from carbonyl compounds by(i) catalytic reduction and(ii) the action of Grignard reagents. Phenols may be prepared by(1) substitution of(i) halogen atom in haloarenes and(ii) sulphonic acid group in aryl sulphonic acids, by OH group(2) by hydrolysis of diazonium salts and(3) industrially from cumene. Alcohols are higher boiling than other classes of compounds, namely hydrocarbons, ethers and haloalkanes of comparable molecular masses. The ability of alcohols, phenols and ethers to form intermolecular hydrogen bonding with water makes them soluble in it. Alcohols and phenols are acidic in nature. Electron withdrawing groups in phenol increase its acidic strength and electron releasing groups decrease it. Alcohols undergo nucleophilic substitution with hydrogen halides to yield alkyl halides. Dehydration of alcohols gives alkenes. On oxidation, primary alcohols yield aldehydes with mild oxidising agents and carboxylic acids with strong oxidising agents while secondary alcohols yield ketones. Tertiary alcohols are resistant to oxidation. The presence of OH group in phenols activates the aromatic ring towards electrophilic substitution and directs the incoming group to ortho and para positions due to resonance effect. Reimer - Tiemann reaction of phenol yields salicylaldehyde. In presence of sodium hydroxide, phenol generates phenoxide ion which is even more reactive than phenol. Thus, in alkaline medium, phenol undergoes Kolbe s reaction. Ethers may be prepared by(i) dehydration of alcohols and(ii) Williamson synthesis. The boiling points of ethers resemble those of alkanes while their solubility is comparable to those of alcohols having same molecular mass. The C O bond in ethers can be cleaved by hydrogen halides. In electrophilic substitution, the alkoxy group activates the aromatic ring and directs the incoming group to ortho and para positions. 221 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers Reprint 2025 - 26 Exercises 7. 1 Write IUPAC names of the following compounds:(i)(ii)(i)(iv)(v)(vi)(vii)(vi)(ix)(x) C H O C H 6 5 2 5(xi) C H O C H(n)(xii) 6 5 7 15 7. 2 Write structures of the compounds whose IUPAC names are as follows:(i) 2 - Methylbutan - 2 - ol(ii) 1 - Phenylpropan - 2 - ol(i) 3, 5 - Dimethylhexane 1, 3, 5 - triol(iv) 2, 3 Diethylphenol(v) 1 Ethoxypropane(vi) 2 - Ethoxy - 3 - methylpentane(vii) Cyclohexylmethanol(vi) 3 - Cyclohexylpentan - 3 - ol(ix) Cyclopent - 3 - en - 1 - ol(x) 4 - Chloro - 3 - ethylbutan - 1 - ol. 7. 3(i) Draw the structures of all isomeric alcohols of molecular formula C H O 5 12 and give their IUPAC names.(ii) Classify the isomers of alcohols in question 11. 3(i) as primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols. 7. 4 Explain why propanol has higher boiling point than that of the hydrocarbon, butane? 7. 5 Alcohols are comparatively more soluble in water than hydrocarbons of comparable molecular masses.

Aldehydes and ketones\nNomenclature\nAldehydes and ketones are the simplest and most important carbonyl\ncompounds.\nThere are two systems of nomenclature of aldehydes and ketones.\n(a) Common names\nAldehydes and ketones are often called by their common names\ninstead of IUPAC names. The common names of most aldehydes are\nderived from the common names of the corresponding carboxylic\nacids [Section 8.6.1] by replacing the ending –ic of acid with aldehyde.\nAt the same time, the names reflect the Latin or Greek term for the\noriginal source of the acid or aldehyde. The location of the substituent\nin the carbon chain is indicated by Greek letters a, b, g, d, etc. The\na-carbon being the one directly linked to the aldehyde group, b-\ncarbon the next, and so on. For example\nChemistry 228\nReprint 2025-26\nThe common names of ketones are derived by naming two alkyl\nor aryl groups bonded to the carbonyl group. The locations of\nsubstituents are indicated by Greek letters, a a¢, b b¢ and so on\nbeginning with the carbon atoms next to the carbonyl group,\nindicated as aa¢. Some ketones have historical common names,\nthe simplest dimethyl ketone is called acetone. Alkyl phenyl\nketones are usually named by adding the name of acyl group as\nprefix to the word phenone. For example\n(b) IUPAC names\nThe IUPAC names of open chain aliphatic aldehydes and ketones\nare derived from the names of the corresponding alkanes by\nreplacing the ending –e with –al and –one respectively. In case of\naldehydes the longest carbon chain is numbered starting from the\ncarbon of the aldehyde group while in case of ketones the\nnumbering begins from the end nearer to the carbonyl group. The\nsubstituents are prefixed in alphabetical order along with numerals\nindicating their positions in the carbon chain. The same applies to\ncyclic ketones, where the carbonyl carbon is numbered one. When\nthe aldehyde group is attached to a ring, the suffix carbaldehyde\nis added after the full name of the cycloalkane. The numbering of\nthe ring carbon atoms start from the carbon atom attached to the\naldehyde group. The name of the simplest aromatic aldehyde\ncarrying the aldehyde group on a benzene ring is\nbenzenecarbaldehyde. However, the common name benzaldehyde\nis also accepted by IUPAC. Other aromatic aldehydes are hence\nnamed as substituted benzaldehydes.\n229 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids\nReprint 2025-26\nThe common and IUPAC names of some aldehydes and ketones are\ngiven in Table 8.1.\nTable 8.1: Common and IUPAC Names of Some Aldehydes and Ketones\nStructure Common name IUPAC name\nAldehydes\nHCHO Formaldehyde Methanal\nCH CHO Acetaldehyde Ethanal\n3\n(CH ) CHCHO Isobutyraldehyde 2-Methylpropanal\n32\ng-Methylcyclohexanecarbaldehyde 3-Methylcyclohexanecarbaldehyde\nCH CH(OCH )CHO a-Methoxypropionaldehyde 2-Methoxypropanal\n3 3\nCH CH CH CH CHO Valeraldehyde Pentanal\n3 2 2 2\nCH =CHCHO Acrolein Prop-2-enal\n2\nPhthaldehyde Benzene-1,2-dicarbaldehyde\n3-Bromobenzenecarbaldehyde\nor\nm-Bromobenzaldehyde 3-Bromobenzaldehyde\nKetones\nCH COCH CH CH Methyl n-propyl ketone Pentan-2-one\n3 2 2 3\n(CH ) CHCOCH(CH ) Diisopropyl ketone 2,4-Dimethylpentan-3-one\n32 3 2\na-Methylcyclohexanone 2-Methylcyclohexanone\n(CH ) C=CHCOCH Mesityl oxide 4-Methylpent-3-en-2-one\n3 2 3\nChemistry 230\nReprint 2025-26\n8.1.2 Structure of The carbonyl carbon atom is sp2-hybridised and forms three sigma (s)\nthe bonds. The fourth valence electron of carbon remains in its p-orbital\nCarbonyl and forms a p-bond with oxygen by overlap with p-orbital of an oxygen.\nGroup In addition, the oxygen atom also has two non bonding electron pairs.\nThus, the carbonyl carbon and the three atoms attached to it lie in the\nsame plane and the p-electron cloud is above and below this plane. The\nbond angles are approximately 120° as expected of a trigonal coplanar\nstructure (Figure 8.1).\np\nFig.8.1 Orbital diagram for the formation of carbonyl group\nThe carbon-oxygen double bond is polarised due to higher\nelectronegativity of oxygen relative to carbon. Hence, the carbonyl\ncarbon is an electrophilic (Lewis acid), and carbonyl\noxygen, a nucleophilic (Lewis base) centre. Carbonyl\ncompounds have substantial dipole moments and are\npolar than ethers.

From hydrocarbons\nAromatic aldehydes (benzaldehyde and its derivatives) are prepared\nfrom aromatic hydrocarbons by the following methods:\n(i) By oxidation of methylbenzene\nStrong oxidising agents oxidise toluene and its derivatives to\nbenzoic acids. However, it is possible to stop the oxidation at\nthe aldehyde stage with suitable reagents that convert the methyl\ngroup to an intermediate that is difficult to oxidise further. The\nfollowing methods are used for this purpose.\n(a) Use of chromyl chloride (CrO Cl ): Chromyl chloride oxidises\n2 2\nmethyl group to a chromium complex, which on hydrolysis\ngives corresponding benzaldehyde.\nChemistry 232\nReprint 2025-26\nThis reaction is called Etard reaction.\n(b) Use of chromic oxide (CrO ): Toluene or substituted toluene\n3\nis converted to benzylidene diacetate on treating with chromic\noxide in acetic anhydride.

Ethanal is a volatile liquid.\nOther aldehydes and ketones are liquid or solid at room temperature.\nThe boiling points of aldehydes and ketones are higher than\nhydrocarbons and ethers of comparable molecular masses. It is due to\nweak molecular association in aldehydes and ketones arising out of the\ndipole-dipole interactions. Also, their boiling points are lower than those\nof alcohols of similar molecular masses due to absence of intermolecular\nhydrogen bonding. The following compounds of molecular masses 58\nand 60 are ranked in order of increasing boiling points.\nb.p.(K) Molecular Mass\nn-Butane 273 58\nMethoxyethane 281 60\nPropanal 322 58\nAcetone 329 58\nPropan-1-ol 370 60\nThe lower members of aldehydes and ketones such as methanal,\nethanal and propanone are miscible with water in all proportions,\nbecause they form hydrogen bond with water.\nHowever, the solubility of aldehydes and ketones decreases rapidly\non increasing the length of alkyl chain. All aldehydes and ketones are\nfairly soluble in organic solvents like benzene, ether, methanol,\nchloroform, etc. The lower aldehydes have sharp pungent odours. As\nthe size of the molecule increases, the odour becomes less pungent\nand more fragrant. In fact, many naturally occurring aldehydes and\nketones are used in the blending of perfumes and flavouring agents.\nArrange the following compounds in the increasing order of their EEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 88888.....22222\nboiling points:\nCH CH CH CHO, CH CH CH CH OH, H C -O-C H , CH CH CH CH\n3 2 2 3 2 2 2 5 2 2 5 3 2 2 3\nThe molecular masses of these compounds are in the range of 72 to SSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\n74.

Nucleophilic addition reactions\nContrary to electrophilic addition reactions observed in alkenes, the\naldehydes and ketones undergo nucleophilic addition reactions.\n(i) Mechanism of nucleophilic addition reactions\nA nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbon atom of the polar\ncarbonyl group from a direction approximately perpendicular\nto the plane of sp2 hybridised orbitals of carbonyl carbon (Fig.\n8.2). The hybridisation of carbon changes from sp2 to sp3 in\nthis process, and a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate is\nproduced. This intermediate captures a proton from the\nreaction medium to give\nthe electrically neutral\nproduct. The net result is\naddition of Nu– and H+\nacross the carbon oxygen\ndouble bond as shown in\nFig. 8.2.\nFig.8.2: Nucleophilic attack on carbonyl carbon\n(ii) Reactivity\nAldehydes are generally more reactive than ketones in\nnucleophilic addition reactions due to steric and electronic\nreasons. Sterically, the presence of two relatively large\nsubstituents in ketones hinders the approach of nucleophile to\ncarbonyl carbon than in aldehydes having only one such\nsubstituent. Electronically, aldehydes are more reactive than\nketones because two alkyl groups reduce the electrophilicity of\nthe carbonyl carbon more effectively than in former.\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 88888.....33333 Would you expect benzaldehyde to be more reactive or less reactive in\nnucleophilic addition reactions than propanal? Explain your answer.\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn The carbon atom of the carbonyl group of benzaldehyde is less\nelectrophilic than carbon atom of the carbonyl group present in\npropanal. The polarity of the carbonyl\ngroup is reduced in benzaldehyde due\nto resonance as shown below and\nhence it is less reactive than propanal.\nChemistry 236\nReprint 2025-26\n(iii) Some important examples of nucleophilic addition and\nnucleophilic addition-elimination reactions:\n(a) Addition of hydrogen cyanide (HCN): Aldehydes\nand ketones react with hydrogen cyanide (HCN)\nto yield cyanohydrins. This reaction occurs very\nslowly with pure HCN. Therefore, it is catalysed\nby a base and the generated cyanide ion (CN-)\nbeing a stronger nucleophile readily adds to\ncarbonyl compounds to yield corresponding\ncyanohydrin.\nCyanohydrins are useful synthetic\nintermediates.\n(b) Addition of sodium hydrogensulphite: Sodium\nhydrogensulphite adds to aldehydes and\nketones to form the addition products.\nThe position of\nthe equilibrium\nlies largely to\nthe right hand\nside for most\naldehydes and to\nthe left for most\nketones due to steric reasons. The hydrogensulphite addition\ncompound is water soluble and can be converted back to the\noriginal carbonyl compound by treating it with dilute mineral\nacid or alkali. Therefore, these are useful for separation and\npurification of aldehydes.\n(c) Addition of Grignard reagents: (refer Unit 7, Class XII).\n(d) Addition of alcohols: Aldehydes react with one equivalent of\nmonohydric alcohol in the presence of dry hydrogen chloride\nto yield alkoxyalcohol intermediate, known as hemiacetals,\nwhich further react with one more molecule of alcohol to\ngive a gem-dialkoxy\ncompound known as\nacetal as shown in the\nreaction.\nKetones react with\nethylene glycol under\nsimilar conditions to form\ncyclic products known as\nethylene glycol ketals.\nDry hydrogen chloride\nprotonates the oxygen of\nthe carbonyl compounds\nand therefore, increases\nthe electrophilicity of the\ncarbonyl carbon facilitating\n237 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids\nReprint 2025-26\nthe nucleophilic attack of ethylene glycol.

Their oxidation\ninvolves carbon-carbon bond cleavage to afford a mixture of carboxylic\nacids having lesser number of carbon atoms than the parent ketone.\nThe mild oxidising agents given below are used to distinguish\naldehydes from ketones:\n(i) Tollens’ test: On warming an aldehyde with freshly prepared\nammoniacal silver nitrate solution (Tollens’ reagent), a bright\nsilver mirror is produced due to the formation of silver metal.\nThe aldehydes are oxidised to corresponding carboxylate anion.\nThe reaction occurs in alkaline medium.\n(ii) Fehling’s test: Fehling reagent comprises of two solutions,\nFehling solution A and Fehling solution B. Fehling solution A is\naqueous copper sulphate and Fehling solution B is alkaline\nsodium potassium tartarate (Rochelle salt). These two solutions\nare mixed in equal amounts before test. On heating an aldehyde\nwith Fehling’s reagent, a reddish brown precipitate is obtained.\nAldehydes are oxidised to corresponding carboxylate anion.\nAromatic aldehydes do not respond to this test.\n239 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids\nReprint 2025-26\n(iii) Oxidation of methyl ketones by haloform reaction:\nAldehydes and ketones having at least one methyl group\nlinked to the carbonyl carbon atom (methyl ketones)\nare oxidised by sodium hypohalite to sodium salts of\ncorresponding carboxylic\nacids having one carbon\natom less than that of\ncarbonyl compound.

From alkylbenzenes\nAromatic carboxylic acids can be prepared by vigorous oxidation of\nalkyl benzenes with chromic acid or acidic or alkaline potassium\npermanganate. The entire side chain is oxidised to the carboxyl group\nirrespective of length of the side chain. Primary and secondary alkyl\ngroups are oxidised in this manner while tertiary group is not affected.\nSuitably substituted alkenes are also oxidised to carboxylic acids\nwith these oxidising reagents.\n3. From nitriles and amides\nNitriles are hydrolysed to amides and then to acids in the presence of\n\nH+ or OHas catalyst. Mild reaction conditions are used to stop the\nreaction at the amide stage.\n4. From Grignard reagents\nGrignard reagents react with carbon dioxide (dry ice) to form salts of\ncarboxylic acids which in turn give corresponding carboxylic acids\nafter acidification with mineral acid.\nAs we know, the Grignard reagents and nitriles can be prepared\nfrom alkyl halides (refer Unit 6, Class XII). The above methods\nChemistry 246\nReprint 2025-26\n(3 and 4) are useful for converting alkyl halides into corresponding\ncarboxylic acids having one carbon atom more than that present in\nalkyl halides (ascending the series).\n5. From acyl halides and anhydrides\nAcid chlorides when hydrolysed with water give carboxylic acids or more\nreadily hydrolysed with aqueous base to give carboxylate ions which on\nacidification provide corresponding carboxylic acids. Anhydrides on the\nother hand are hydrolysed to corresponding acid(s) with water.\n6. From esters\nAcidic hydrolysis of esters gives directly carboxylic acids while basic\nhydrolysis gives carboxylates, which on acidification give\ncorresponding carboxylic acids.\nWrite chemical reactions to affect the following transformations: EEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 88888.....55555\n(i) Butan-1-ol to butanoic acid\n(ii) Benzyl alcohol to phenylethanoic acid\n(iii) 3-Nitrobromobenzene to 3-nitrobenzoic acid\n(iv) 4-Methylacetophenone to benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid\n(v) Cyclohexene to hexane-1,6-dioic acid\n(vi) Butanal to butanoic acid.\n247 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids\nReprint 2025-26\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn (i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n(v)\n(vi)\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\n8.7 Show how each of the following compounds can be\nconverted to benzoic acid.\n(i) Ethylbenzene (ii) Acetophenone\n(iii) Bromobenzene (iv) Phenylethene (Styrene)\nChemistry 248\nReprint 2025-26\n88888.....88888 PPPPPhhhhhyyyyysssssiiiiicccccaaaaalllll Aliphatic carboxylic acids upto nine carbon atoms are colourless\nliquids at room temperature with unpleasant odours.

Carboxylic acids are higher boiling\nliquids than aldehydes, ketones and even alcohols of\ncomparable molecular masses. This is due to more extensive\nassociation of carboxylic acid molecules through\nintermolecular hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonds are\nnot broken completely even in the vapour phase. In fact,\nIn vapour state or in most carboxylic acids exist as dimer in the vapour phase\naprotic solvent or in the aprotic solvents.\nSimple aliphatic carboxylic acids having upto four\ncarbon atoms are miscible in water due to the formation\nof hydrogen bonds with water. The solubility decreases\nwith increasing number of carbon atoms. Higher\ncarboxylic acids are practically insoluble in water due to\nthe increased hydrophobic interaction of hydrocarbon\npart. Benzoic acid, the simplest aromatic carboxylic acid\nis nearly insoluble in cold water. Carboxylic acids are\nHydrogen bonding of\nalso soluble in less polar organic solvents like benzene,\nRCOOH with H O\n2\nether, alcohol, chloroform, etc.\n88888.....99999 CCCCChhhhheeeeemmmmmiiiiicccccaaaaalllll RRRRReeeeeaaaaaccccctttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss The reaction of carboxylic acids are classified as follows:\n8.9.1 Reactions Acidity\nInvolving\nReactions with metals and alkalies\nCleavage of\nThe carboxylic acids like alcohols evolve hydrogen with electropositive\nO–H Bond\nmetals and form salts with alkalies similar to phenols. However, unlike\nphenols they react with weaker bases such as carbonates and\nhydrogencarbonates to evolve carbon dioxide. This reaction is used to\ndetect the presence of carboxyl group in an organic compound.\nCarboxylic acids dissociate in water to give resonance stabilised\ncarboxylate anions and hydronium ion.\n249 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids\nReprint 2025-26\nFor the above reaction:\nwhere K , is equilibrium constant and K is the acid dissociation\neq a\nconstant.\nFor convenience, the strength of an acid is generally indicated by\nits pK value rather than its K value.\na a\npK = – log K\na a\nThe pK of hydrochloric acid is –7.0, where as pK of trifluoroacetic\na a\nacid (the strongest carboxylic acid), benzoic acid and acetic acid are\n0.23, 4.19 and 4.76, respectively.\nSmaller the pK , the stronger the acid ( the better it is as a proton\na\ndonor). Strong acids have pK values < 1, the acids with pK values\na a\nbetween 1 and 5 are considered to be moderately strong acids, weak\nacids have pK values between 5 and 15, and extremely weak acids\na\nhave pK values >15.\na\nCarboxylic acids are weaker than mineral acids, but they are stronger\nacids than alcohols and many simple phenols (pK is ~16 for ethanol\na\nand 10 for phenol). In fact, carboxylic acids are amongst the most acidic\norganic compounds you have studied so far. You already know why\nphenols are more acidic than alcohols. The higher acidity of carboxylic\nacids as compared to phenols can be understood similarly. The conjugate\nbase of carboxylic acid, a carboxylate ion, is stabilised by two equivalent\nresonance structures in which the negative charge is at the more\nelectronegative oxygen atom. The conjugate base of phenol, a phenoxide\nion, has non-equivalent resonance structures in which the negative charge\nis at the less electronegative carbon atom. Therefore, resonance in\nphenoxide ion is not as important as it is in carboxylate ion. Further, the\nnegative charge is delocalised over two electronegative oxygen atoms in\ncarboxylate ion whereas it is less effectively delocalised over one oxygen\natom and less electronegative carbon atoms in phenoxide ion (Unit 7,\nClass XII). Thus, the carboxylate ion is more stabilised than phenoxide\nion, so carboxylic acids are more acidic than phenols.\nEffect of substituents on the acidity of carboxylic acids:\nSubstituents may affect the stability of the conjugate base and thus,\nalso affect the acidity of the carboxylic acids. Electron withdrawing\ngroups increase the acidity of carboxylic acids by stabilising the\nconjugate base through delocalisation of the negative charge by\ninductive and/or resonance effects. Conversely, electron donating groups\ndecrease the acidity by destabilising the conjugate base.\nElectron withdrawing group (EWG) Electron donating group (EDG)\nstabilises the carboxylate anion destabilises the carboxylate\nand strengthens the acid anion and weakens the acid\nChemistry 250\nReprint 2025-26\nThe effect of the following groups in increasing acidity order is\nPh < I < Br < Cl < F < CN < NO < CF\n2 3\nThus, the following acids are arranged in order of increasing acidity\n(based on pK values):\na\nCF COOH > CCl COOH > CHCl COOH > NO CH COOH > NC-CH COOH >\n3 3 2 2 2 2\nFCH COOH > ClCH COOH > BrCH COOH > HCOOH > ClCH CH COOH >\n2 2 2 2 2\n(continue)\nC H COOH > C H CH COOH > CH COOH > CH CH COOH\n6 5 6 5 2 3 3 2\n(continue )\nDirect attachment of groups such as phenyl or vinyl to the carboxylic\nacid, increases the acidity of corresponding carboxylic acid, contrary to\nthe decrease expected due to resonance effect shown below:\nThis is because of greater electronegativity of sp2 hybridised carbon\nto which carboxyl carbon is attached. The presence of electron\nwithdrawing group on the phenyl of aromatic carboxylic acid increases\ntheir acidity while electron donating groups decrease their acidity.\nCOOH COOH COOH\nNO\nOCH 2\n3\n4-Methoxy Benzoic acid 4-Nitrobenzoic\nacid\nbenzoic acid\n(pK a = 4.46) (pK a = 4.19) (pK a = 3.41)\n8.9.2 Reactions 1.

Protonation of the\ncarbonyl oxygen activates the carbonyl group towards nucleophilic addition of the\nalcohol. Proton transfer in the tetrahedral intermediate converts the hydroxyl group\ninto –+OH group, which, being a better leaving group, is eliminated as neutral water\n2\nmolecule. The protonated ester so formed finally loses a proton to give the ester.\n3. Reactions with PCl , PCl and SOCl\n5 3 2\nThe hydroxyl group of carboxylic acids, behaves like that of alcohols\nand is easily replaced by chlorine atom on treating with PCl , PCl or\n5 3\nSOCl . Thionyl chloride (SOCl ) is preferred because the other two\n2 2\nproducts are gaseous and escape the reaction mixture making the\npurification of the products easier.\n4. Reaction with ammonia\nCarboxylic acids react with ammonia to give ammonium salt which\non further heating at high temperature give amides. For example:\nChemistry 252\nReprint 2025-26\n8.9.3 Reactions 1. Reduction\nInvolving\nCarboxylic acids are reduced to primary alcohols by lithium\n–COOH\naluminium hydride or better with diborane. Diborane does not easily\nGroup\nreduce functional groups such as ester, nitro, halo, etc. Sodium\nborohydride does not reduce the carboxyl group.\n2. Decarboxylation\nCarboxylic acids lose carbon dioxide to form hydrocarbons when their\nsodium salts are heated with sodalime (NaOH and CaO in the ratio of\n3 : 1). The reaction is known as decarboxylation.\nAlkali metal salts of carboxylic acids also undergo decarboxylation\non electrolysis of their aqueous solutions and form hydrocarbons having\ntwice the number of carbon atoms present in the alkyl group of the acid.\nThe reaction is known as Kolbe electrolysis (Unit 9, Class XI).\n8.9.4 Substitution 1. Halogenation\nReactions in the Carboxylic acids having an α-hydrogen are halogenated at the\nHydrocarbon Part α-position on treatment with chlorine or bromine in the presence of\nsmall amount of red phosphorus to give α-halocarboxylic acids. The\nreaction is known as Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction.\n253 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids\nReprint 2025-26\n2. Ring substitution\nAromatic carboxylic acids undergo electrophilic substitution reactions\nin which the carboxyl group acts as a deactivating and meta-directing\ngroup. They however, do not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction\n(because the carboxyl group is deactivating and the catalyst\naluminium chloride (Lewis acid) gets bonded to the carboxyl group).\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\n8.8 Which acid of each pair shown here would you expect to be stronger?\n(i) CH CO H or CH FCO H (ii) CH FCO H or CH ClCO H\n3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n(iii) CH FCH CH CO H or CH CHFCH CO H\n2 2 2 2 3 2 2\n(iv)\n88888.....1111100000 UUUUUssssseeeeesssss ooooofffff\nMethanoic acid is used in rubber, textile, dyeing, leather and electroplating\nCCCCCaaaaarrrrrbbbbboooooxxxxxyyyyyllllliiiiiccccc industries.

These are highly polar molecules.\nTherefore, they boil at higher temperatures than the hydrocarbons and weakly\npolar compounds such as ethers of comparable molecular masses. The lower\nmembers are more soluble in water because they form hydrogen bonds with water.\nThe higher members, because of large size of hydrophobic chain of carbon atoms,\nare insoluble in water but soluble in common organic solvents. Aldehydes are\nprepared by dehydrogenation or controlled oxidation of primary alcohols and\ncontrolled or selective reduction of acyl halides. Aromatic aldehydes may also be\nprepared by oxidation of (i) methylbenzene with chromyl chloride or CrO in the\n3\npresence of acetic anhydride, (ii) formylation of arenes with carbon monoxide and\nhydrochloric acid in the presence of anhydrous aluminium chloride, and (iii) cuprous\nchloride or by hydrolysis of benzal chloride. Ketones are prepared by oxidation of\nsecondary alcohols and hydration of alkynes. Ketones are also prepared by reaction\nof acyl chloride with dialkylcadmium. A good method for the preparation of aromatic\nketones is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of aromatic hydrocarbons with acyl chlorides\nor anhydrides. Both aldehydes and ketones can be prepared by ozonolysis of alkenes.\nAldehydes and ketones undergo nucleophilic addition reactions onto the carbonyl\ngroup with a number of nucleophiles such as, HCN, NaHSO , alcohols (or diols),\n3\nChemistry 254\nReprint 2025-26\nammonia derivatives, and Grignard reagents. The a-hydrogens in aldehydes and\nketones are acidic. Therefore, aldehydes and ketones having at least one a-hydrogen,\nundergo Aldol condensation in the presence of a base to give a-hydroxyaldehydes\n(aldol) and a-hydroxyketones(ketol), respectively. Aldehydes having no a-hydrogen\nundergo Cannizzaro reaction in the presence of concentrated alkali. Aldehydes\nand ketones are reduced to alcohols with NaBH , LiAlH , or by catalytic hydrogenation.\n4 4\nThe carbonyl group of aldehydes and ketones can be reduced to a methylene group\nby Clemmensen reduction or Wolff-Kishner reduction. Aldehydes are easily\noxidised to carboxylic acids by mild oxidising reagents such as Tollens’ reagent and\nFehling’s reagent. These oxidation reactions are used to distinguish aldehydes from\nketones. Carboxylic acids are prepared by the oxidation of primary alcohols, aldehydes\nand alkenes by hydrolysis of nitriles, and by treatment of Grignard reagents with\ncarbon dioxide. Aromatic carboxylic acids are also prepared by side-chain oxidation\nof alkylbenzenes. Carboxylic acids are considerably more acidic than alcohols and\nmost of simple phenols. Carboxylic acids are reduced to primary alcohols with LiAlH ,\n4\nor better with diborane in ether solution and also undergo a-halogenation with Cl\n2\nand Br in the presence of red phosphorus (Hell-Volhard Zelinsky reaction).\n2\nMethanal, ethanal, propanone, benzaldehyde, formic acid, acetic acid and benzoic\nacid are highly useful compounds in industry.\nExercises\n8.1 What is meant by the following terms ?

The general formulas of these classes of compounds are given below: Reprint 2025 - 26 Aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids are widespread in plants and animal kingdom. They play an important role in biochemical processes of life. They add fragrance and flavour to nature, for example, vanillin(from vanilla beans), salicylaldehyde(from meadow sweet) and cinnamaldehyde(from cinnamon) have very pleasant fragrances. They are used in many food products and pharmaceuticals to add flavours. Some of these families are manufactured for use as solvents(i. e., acetone) and for preparing materials like adhesives, paints, resins, perfumes, plastics, fabrics, etc. 88888. 11111 Nomenclature and Structure of Carbonyl Group 8. 1. 1 I. Aldehydes and ketones Nomenclature Aldehydes and ketones are the simplest and most important carbonyl compounds. There are two systems of nomenclature of aldehydes and ketones.(a) Common names Aldehydes and ketones are often called by their common names instead of IUPAC names. The common names of most aldehydes are derived from the common names of the corresponding carboxylic acids[Section 8. 6. 1] by replacing the ending ic of acid with aldehyde. At the same time, the names reflect the Latin or Greek term for the original source of the acid or aldehyde. The location of the substituent in the carbon chain is indicated by Greek letters a, b, g, d, etc. The a - carbon being the one directly linked to the aldehyde group, b - carbon the next, and so on. For example Chemistry 228 Reprint 2025 - 26 The common names of ketones are derived by naming two alkyl or aryl groups bonded to the carbonyl group. The locations of substituents are indicated by Greek letters, a a ¢, b b ¢ and so on beginning with the carbon atoms next to the carbonyl group, indicated as aa ¢. Some ketones have historical common names, the simplest dimethyl ketone is called acetone. Alkyl phenyl ketones are usually named by adding the name of acyl group as prefix to the word phenone. For example(b) IUPAC names The IUPAC names of open chain aliphatic aldehydes and ketones are derived from the names of the corresponding alkanes by replacing the ending e with al and one respectively. In case of aldehydes the longest carbon chain is numbered starting from the carbon of the aldehyde group while in case of ketones the numbering begins from the end nearer to the carbonyl group. The substituents are prefixed in alphabetical order along with numerals indicating their positions in the carbon chain. The same applies to cyclic ketones, where the carbonyl carbon is numbered one. When the aldehyde group is attached to a ring, the suffix carbaldehyde is added after the full name of the cycloalkane. The numbering of the ring carbon atoms start from the carbon atom attached to the aldehyde group. The name of the simplest aromatic aldehyde carrying the aldehyde group on a benzene ring is benzenecarbaldehyde. However, the common name benzaldehyde is also accepted by IUPAC. Other aromatic aldehydes are hence named as substituted benzaldehydes. 229 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids Reprint 2025 - 26 The common and IUPAC names of some aldehydes and ketones are given in Table 8. 1.

The fourth valence electron of carbon remains in its p - orbital Carbonyl and forms a p - bond with oxygen by overlap with p - orbital of an oxygen. Group In addition, the oxygen atom also has two non bonding electron pairs. Thus, the carbonyl carbon and the three atoms attached to it lie in the same plane and the p - electron cloud is above and below this plane. The bond angles are approximately 120 ° as expected of a trigonal coplanar structure(Figure 8. 1). P Fig. 8. 1 Orbital diagram for the formation of carbonyl group The carbon - oxygen double bond is polarised due to higher electronegativity of oxygen relative to carbon. Hence, the carbonyl carbon is an electrophilic(Lewis acid), and carbonyl oxygen, a nucleophilic(Lewis base) centre. Carbonyl compounds have substantial dipole moments and are polar than ethers. The high polarity of the carbonyl group is explained on the basis of resonance involving a neutral(A) and a dipolar(B) structures as shown.

By oxidation of alcohols of Aldehydes and ketones are generally prepared by oxidation of primary Aldehydes and secondary alcohols, respectively(Unit 7, Class XII). And 2. By dehydrogenation of alcohols Ketones This method is suitable for volatile alcohols and is of industrial application. In this method alcohol vapours are passed over heavy metal catalysts(Ag or Cu). Primary and secondary alcohols give aldehydes and ketones, respectively(Unit 7, Class XII). 3. From hydrocarbons(i) By ozonolysis of alkenes: As we know, ozonolysis of alkenes followed by reaction with zinc dust and water gives aldehydes, 231 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids Reprint 2025 - 26 ketones or a mixture of both depending on the substitution pattern of the alkene(Unit 9, Class XI).(ii) By hydration of alkynes: Addition of water to ethyne in the presence of H SO and HgSO gives acetaldehyde. All other 2 4 4 alkynes give ketones in this reaction(Unit 9, Class XI). 8. 2. 2 Preparation 1. From acyl chloride(acid chloride) of Acyl chloride(acid chloride) is hydrogenated over catalyst, palladium Aldehydes on barium sulphate. This reaction is called Rosenmund reduction. 2. From nitriles and esters Nitriles are reduced to corresponding imine with stannous chloride in the presence of hydrochloric acid, which on hydrolysis give corresponding aldehyde. This reaction is called Stephen reaction. Alternatively, nitriles are selectively reduced by diisobutylaluminium hydride,(DIBAL - H) to imines followed by hydrolysis to aldehydes: Similarly, esters are also reduced to aldehydes with DIBAL - H. 3. From hydrocarbons Aromatic aldehydes(benzaldehyde and its derivatives) are prepared from aromatic hydrocarbons by the following methods:(i) By oxidation of methylbenzene Strong oxidising agents oxidise toluene and its derivatives to benzoic acids. However, it is possible to stop the oxidation at the aldehyde stage with suitable reagents that convert the methyl group to an intermediate that is difficult to oxidise further. The following methods are used for this purpose.(a) Use of chromyl chloride(Cro Cl): Chromyl chloride oxidises 2 2 methyl group to a chromium complex, which on hydrolysis gives corresponding benzaldehyde. Chemistry 232 Reprint 2025 - 26 This reaction is called Etard reaction.(b) Use of chromic oxide(Cro): Toluene or substituted toluene 3 is converted to benzylidene diacetate on treating with chromic oxide in acetic anhydride. The benzylidene diacetate can be hydrolysed to corresponding benzaldehyde with aqueous acid.(ii) By side chain chlorination followed by hydrolysis Side chain chlorination of toluene gives benzal chloride, which on hydrolysis gives benzaldehyde. This is a commercial method of manufacture of benzaldehyde.(i) By Gatterman Koch reaction When benzene or its derivative is treated with carbon monoxide and hydrogen chloride in the presence of anhydrous aluminium chloride or cuprous chloride, it gives benzaldehyde or substituted benzaldehyde. This reaction is known as Gatterman - Koch reaction. 8. 2. 3 Preparation 1. From acyl chlorides of Ketones Treatment of acyl chlorides with dialkylcadmium, prepared by the reaction of cadmium chloride with Grignard reagent, gives ketones. 233 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids Reprint 2025 - 26 2.

This reaction is known as Friedel - Crafts acylation reaction.

Properties Methanal is a gas at room temperature. Ethanal is a volatile liquid. Other aldehydes and ketones are liquid or solid at room temperature. The boiling points of aldehydes and ketones are higher than hydrocarbons and ethers of comparable molecular masses. It is due to weak molecular association in aldehydes and ketones arising out of the dipole - dipole interactions. Also, their boiling points are lower than those of alcohols of similar molecular masses due to absence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The following compounds of molecular masses 58 and 60 are ranked in order of increasing boiling points. B. p.(K) Molecular Mass n - Butane 273 58 Methoxyethane 281 60 Propanal 322 58 Acetone 329 58 Propan - 1 - ol 370 60 The lower members of aldehydes and ketones such as methanal, ethanal and propanone are miscible with water in all proportions, because they form hydrogen bond with water. However, the solubility of aldehydes and ketones decreases rapidly on increasing the length of alkyl chain. All aldehydes and ketones are fairly soluble in organic solvents like benzene, ether, methanol, chloroform, etc. The lower aldehydes have sharp pungent odours. As the size of the molecule increases, the odour becomes less pungent and more fragrant. In fact, many naturally occurring aldehydes and ketones are used in the blending of perfumes and flavouring agents. Arrange the following compounds in the increasing order of their Example 88888. 22222 boiling points: CH CH CH CHO, CH CH CH CH OH, H C - O - C H, CH CH CH CH 3 2 2 3 2 2 2 5 2 2 5 3 2 2 3 The molecular masses of these compounds are in the range of 72 to Solution 74. Since only butan - 1 - ol molecules are associated due to extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding, therefore, the boiling point of butan - 1 - ol would be the highest. Butanal is more polar than ethoxyethane. Therefore, the intermolecular dipole - dipole attraction is stronger in the former. N - Pentane molecules have only weak van der Waals forces. Hence increasing order of boiling points of the given compounds is as follows: CH CH CH CH < H C - O - C H < CH CH CH CHO < CH CH CH CH OH 3 2 2 3 5 2 2 5 3 2 2 3 2 2 2 235 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids Reprint 2025 - 26 Intext Question 8. 3 Arrange the following compounds in increasing order of their boiling points. CH CHO, CH CH OH, CH OCH, CH CH CH 3 3 2 3 3 3 2 3 88888. 44444 Chemical Since aldehydes and ketones both possess the carbonyl functional group, they undergo similar chemical reactions. Reactions 1. Nucleophilic addition reactions Contrary to electrophilic addition reactions observed in alkenes, the aldehydes and ketones undergo nucleophilic addition reactions.(i) Mechanism of nucleophilic addition reactions A nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbon atom of the polar carbonyl group from a direction approximately perpendicular to the plane of sp2 hybridised orbitals of carbonyl carbon(Fig. 8. 2). The hybridisation of carbon changes from sp2 to sp3 in this process, and a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate is produced. This intermediate captures a proton from the reaction medium to give the electrically neutral product. The net result is addition of Nu and H + across the carbon oxygen double bond as shown in Fig. 8. 2. Fig. 8. 2: Nucleophilic attack on carbonyl carbon(ii) Reactivity Aldehydes are generally more reactive than ketones in nucleophilic addition reactions due to steric and electronic reasons. Sterically, the presence of two relatively large substituents in ketones hinders the approach of nucleophile to carbonyl carbon than in aldehydes having only one such substituent. Electronically, aldehydes are more reactive than ketones because two alkyl groups reduce the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon more effectively than in former. Example 88888. 33333 Would you expect benzaldehyde to be more reactive or less reactive in nucleophilic addition reactions than propanal? Explain your answer. Solution The carbon atom of the carbonyl group of benzaldehyde is less electrophilic than carbon atom of the carbonyl group present in propanal. The polarity of the carbonyl group is reduced in benzaldehyde due to resonance as shown below and hence it is less reactive than propanal. Chemistry 236 Reprint 2025 - 26(i) Some important examples of nucleophilic addition and nucleophilic addition - elimination reactions:(a) Addition of hydrogen cyanide(HCN): Aldehydes and ketones react with hydrogen cyanide(HCN) to yield cyanohydrins. This reaction occurs very slowly with pure HCN. Therefore, it is catalysed by a base and the generated cyanide ion(CN -) being a stronger nucleophile readily adds to carbonyl compounds to yield corresponding cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrins are useful synthetic intermediates.(b) Addition of sodium hydrogensulphite: Sodium hydrogensulphite adds to aldehydes and ketones to form the addition products. The position of the equilibrium lies largely to the right hand side for most aldehydes and to the left for most ketones due to steric reasons. The hydrogensulphite addition compound is water soluble and can be converted back to the original carbonyl compound by treating it with dilute mineral acid or alkali. Therefore, these are useful for separation and purification of aldehydes.(c) Addition of Grignard reagents:(refer Unit 7, Class XII).(d) Addition of alcohols: Aldehydes react with one equivalent of monohydric alcohol in the presence of dry hydrogen chloride to yield alkoxyalcohol intermediate, known as hemiacetals, which further react with one more molecule of alcohol to give a gem - dialkoxy compound known as acetal as shown in the reaction. Ketones react with ethylene glycol under similar conditions to form cyclic products known as ethylene glycol ketals. Dry hydrogen chloride protonates the oxygen of the carbonyl compounds and therefore, increases the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon facilitating 237 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids Reprint 2025 - 26 the nucleophilic attack of ethylene glycol. Acetals and ketals are hydrolysed with aqueous mineral acids to yield corresponding aldehydes and ketones respectively.(e) Addition of ammonia and its derivatives: Nucleophiles, such as ammonia and its derivatives H N - Z add to the carbonyl 2 group of aldehydes and ketones. The reaction is reversible and catalysed by acid. The equilibrium favours the product formation due to rapid dehydration of the intermediate to form > C = N - Z. Z = Alkyl, aryl, OH, NH, C H NH, NHCONH, etc. 2 6 5 2 Table 8. 2: Some N - Substituted Derivatives of Aldehydes and Ketones(> C = N - Z) Z Reagent name Carbonyl derivative Product name - H Ammonia Imine - R Amine Substituted imine(Schiff s base) OH Hydroxylamine Oxime NH Hydrazine Hydrazone 2 Phenylhydrazine Phenylhydrazone 2, 4 - Dinitrophenyl - 2, 4 Dinitrophenyl - hydrazine hydrazone Semicarbazide Semicarbazone * 2, 4 - DNP - derivatives are yellow, orange or red solids, useful for characterisation of aldehydes and ketones. 2. Reduction(i) Reduction to alcohols: Aldehydes and ketones are reduced to primary and secondary alcohols respectively by sodium borohydride(NaBH) or lithium aluminium hydride(Lialh) as 4 4 well as by catalytic hydrogenation(Unit 7, Class XII).(ii) Reduction to hydrocarbons: The carbonyl group of aldehydes and ketones is reduced to CH group on treatment with zinc - 2 amalgam and concentrated hydrochloric acid[Clemmensen Chemistry 238 Reprint 2025 - 26 reduction] or with hydrazine followed by heating with sodium or potassium hydroxide in high boiling solvent such as ethylene glycol(Wolff - Kishner reduction). 3. Oxidation Aldehydes differ from ketones in their oxidation reactions. Aldehydes Bernhard Tollens are easily oxidised to carboxylic acids on treatment with common(1841 - 1918) was a oxidising agents like nitric acid, potassium permanganate, potassium Professor of Chemistry dichromate, etc. Even mild oxidising agents, mainly Tollens reagent at the University of and Fehlings reagent also oxidise aldehydes. Gottingen, Germany. Ketones are generally oxidised under vigorous conditions, i. e., strong oxidising agents and at elevated temperatures. Their oxidation involves carbon - carbon bond cleavage to afford a mixture of carboxylic acids having lesser number of carbon atoms than the parent ketone. The mild oxidising agents given below are used to distinguish aldehydes from ketones:(i) Tollens test: On warming an aldehyde with freshly prepared ammoniacal silver nitrate solution(Tollens reagent), a bright silver mirror is produced due to the formation of silver metal. The aldehydes are oxidised to corresponding carboxylate anion. The reaction occurs in alkaline medium.(ii) Fehling s test: Fehling reagent comprises of two solutions, Fehling solution A and Fehling solution B. Fehling solution A is aqueous copper sulphate and Fehling solution B is alkaline sodium potassium tartarate(Rochelle salt). These two solutions are mixed in equal amounts before test. On heating an aldehyde with Fehling s reagent, a reddish brown precipitate is obtained. Aldehydes are oxidised to corresponding carboxylate anion. Aromatic aldehydes do not respond to this test. 239 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids Reprint 2025 - 26(i) Oxidation of methyl ketones by haloform reaction: Aldehydes and ketones having at least one methyl group linked to the carbonyl carbon atom(methyl ketones) are oxidised by sodium hypohalite to sodium salts of corresponding carboxylic acids having one carbon atom less than that of carbonyl compound. The methyl group is converted to haloform. This oxidation does not affect a carbon - carbon double bond, if present in the molecule. Iodoform reaction with sodium hypoiodite is also used for detection of CH CO group or CH CH(OH) group which produces CH CO group 3 3 3 on oxidation. Example 88888. 44444 An organic compound(A) with molecular formula C H O forms an 8 8 orange - red precipitate with 2, 4 - DNP reagent and gives yellow precipitate on heating with iodine in the presence of sodium hydroxide. It neither reduces Tollens or Fehlings reagent, nor does it decolourise bromine water or Baeyer s reagent. On drastic oxidation with chromic acid, it gives a carboxylic acid(B) having molecular formula C H O. Identify the compounds(A) and(B) and explain the 7 6 2 reactions involved. Solution(A) forms 2, 4 - DNP derivative. Therefore, it is an aldehyde or a ketone. Since it does not reduce Tollens or Fehling reagent,(A) must be a ketone.(A) responds to iodoform test. Therefore, it should be a methyl ketone. The molecular formula of(A) indicates high degree of unsaturation, yet it does not decolourise bromine water or Baeyer s reagent. This indicates the presence of unsaturation due to an aromatic ring. Compound(B), being an oxidation product of a ketone should be a carboxylic acid. The molecular formula of(B) indicates that it should be benzoic acid and compound(A) should, therefore, be a monosubstituted aromatic methyl ketone. The molecular formula of(A) indicates that it should be phenyl methyl ketone(acetophenone). Reactions are as follows: Chemistry 240 Reprint 2025 - 26 4. Reactions due to a - hydrogen Acidity of - hydrogens of aldehydes and ketones: The aldehydes and ketones undergo a number of reactions due to the acidic nature of - hydrogen. The acidity of - hydrogen atoms of carbonyl compounds is due to the strong electron withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group and resonance stabilisation of the conjugate base.(i) Aldol condensation: Aldehydes and ketones having at least one - hydrogen undergo a reaction in the presence of dilute alkali as catalyst to form - hydroxy aldehydes(aldol) or - hydroxy ketones(ketol), respectively. This is known as Aldol reaction. The name aldol is derived from the names of the two functional groups, aldehyde and alcohol, present in the products. The aldol and ketol readily lose water to give, - unsaturated carbonyl compounds which are aldol condensation products and the reaction is called Aldol condensation. Though ketones give ketols(compounds containing a keto and alcohol groups), the general name aldol condensation still applies to the reactions of ketones due to their similarity with aldehydes. 241 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids Reprint 2025 - 26(ii) Cross aldol condensation: When aldol condensation is carried out between two different aldehydes and / or ketones, it is called cross aldol condensation. If both of them contain a - hydrogen atoms, it gives a mixture of four products. This is illustrated below by aldol reaction of a mixture of ethanal and propanal. Ketones can also be used as one component in the cross aldol reactions. 5. Other reactions(i) Cannizzaro reaction: Aldehydes which do not have an a - hydrogen atom, undergo self oxidation and reduction(disproportionation) reaction on heating with concentrated alkali. In this reaction, one molecule of the aldehyde is reduced to alcohol while another is oxidised to carboxylic acid salt. D D Chemistry 242 Reprint 2025 - 26(ii) Electrophilic substitution reaction: Aromatic aldehydes and ketones undergo electrophilic substitution at the ring in which the carbonyl group acts as a deactivating and meta - directing group.

Hint: Consider steric effect and electronic effect. 8. 5 Predict the products of the following reactions:(i)(ii)(i)(iv) 88888. 55555 Uses of In chemical industry aldehydes and ketones are used as solvents, Aldehydes starting materials and reagents for the synthesis of other products. Formaldehyde is well known as formalin(40 %) solution used to preserve and Ketones biological specimens and to prepare bakelite(a phenol - formaldehyde resin), urea - formaldehyde glues and other polymeric products. Acetaldehyde is used primarily as a starting material in the manufacture of acetic acid, ethyl acetate, vinyl acetate, polymers and drugs. Benzaldehyde is used in perfumery and in dye industries. Acetone and ethyl methyl ketone are common industrial solvents. Many aldehydes and ketones, e. g., butyraldehyde, vanillin, acetophenone, camphor, etc. Are well known for their odours and flavours. 243 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids Reprint 2025 - 26 Carboxylic Acids Carbon compounds containing a carboxyl functional group, COOH are called carboxylic acids. The carboxyl group, consists of a carbonyl group attached to a hydroxyl group, hence its name carboxyl. Carboxylic acids may be aliphatic(RCOOH) or aromatic(ArCOOH) depending on the group, alkyl or aryl, attached to carboxylic carbon. Large number of carboxylic acids are found in nature. Some higher members of aliphatic carboxylic acids(C C) known as fatty acids, occur in natural fats as esters of 12 18 glycerol. Carboxylic acids serve as starting material for several other important organic compounds such as anhydrides, esters, acid chlorides, amides, etc. 88888. 66666 Nomenclature and Structure of Carboxyl Group 8. 6. 1 Since carboxylic acids are amongst the earliest organic compounds to Nomenclature be isolated from nature, a large number of them are known by their common names. The common names end with the suffix ic acid and have been derived from Latin or Greek names of their natural sources. For example, formic acid(HCOOH) was first obtained from red ants(Latin: formica means ant), acetic acid(CH COOH) from vinegar(Latin: 3 acetum, means vinegar), butyric acid(CH CH CH COOH) from rancid 3 2 2 butter(Latin: butyrum, means butter). In the IUPAC system, aliphatic carboxylic acids are named by replacing the ending e in the name of the corresponding alkane with oic acid. In numbering the carbon chain, the carboxylic carbon is numbered one. For naming compounds containing more than one carboxyl group, the alkyl chain leaving carboxyl groups is numbered and the number of carboxyl groups is indicated by adding the multiplicative prefix, dicarboxylic acid, tricarboxylic acid, etc. To the name of parent alkyl chain. The position of COOH groups are indicated by the arabic numeral before the multiplicative prefix. Some of the carboxylic acids along with their common and IUPAC names are listed in Table 8. 3.

Preparation 1. From primary alcohols and aldehydes of Carboxylic Primary alcohols are readily oxidised to carboxylic acids with common Acids oxidising agents such as potassium permanganate(KMnO) in 4 neutral, acidic or alkaline media or by potassium dichromate(K Cr O) 2 2 7 and chromium trioxide(Cro) in acidic media(Jones reagent). 3 Jones reagent 245 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids Reprint 2025 - 26 Carboxylic acids are also prepared from aldehydes by the use of mild oxidising agents(Section 8. 4). 2. From alkylbenzenes Aromatic carboxylic acids can be prepared by vigorous oxidation of alkyl benzenes with chromic acid or acidic or alkaline potassium permanganate. The entire side chain is oxidised to the carboxyl group irrespective of length of the side chain. Primary and secondary alkyl groups are oxidised in this manner while tertiary group is not affected. Suitably substituted alkenes are also oxidised to carboxylic acids with these oxidising reagents. 3. From nitriles and amides Nitriles are hydrolysed to amides and then to acids in the presence of H + or Ohas catalyst. Mild reaction conditions are used to stop the reaction at the amide stage. 4. From Grignard reagents Grignard reagents react with carbon dioxide(dry ice) to form salts of carboxylic acids which in turn give corresponding carboxylic acids after acidification with mineral acid. As we know, the Grignard reagents and nitriles can be prepared from alkyl halides(refer Unit 6, Class XII). The above methods Chemistry 246 Reprint 2025 - 26(3 and 4) are useful for converting alkyl halides into corresponding carboxylic acids having one carbon atom more than that present in alkyl halides(ascending the series). 5. From acyl halides and anhydrides Acid chlorides when hydrolysed with water give carboxylic acids or more readily hydrolysed with aqueous base to give carboxylate ions which on acidification provide corresponding carboxylic acids. Anhydrides on the other hand are hydrolysed to corresponding acid(s) with water. 6. From esters Acidic hydrolysis of esters gives directly carboxylic acids while basic hydrolysis gives carboxylates, which on acidification give corresponding carboxylic acids.

The higher Properties acids are wax like solids and are practically odourless due to their low volatility. Carboxylic acids are higher boiling liquids than aldehydes, ketones and even alcohols of comparable molecular masses. This is due to more extensive association of carboxylic acid molecules through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonds are not broken completely even in the vapour phase. In fact, In vapour state or in most carboxylic acids exist as dimer in the vapour phase aprotic solvent or in the aprotic solvents. Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids having upto four carbon atoms are miscible in water due to the formation of hydrogen bonds with water. The solubility decreases with increasing number of carbon atoms. Higher carboxylic acids are practically insoluble in water due to the increased hydrophobic interaction of hydrocarbon part. Benzoic acid, the simplest aromatic carboxylic acid is nearly insoluble in cold water. Carboxylic acids are Hydrogen bonding of also soluble in less polar organic solvents like benzene, RCOOH with H O 2 ether, alcohol, chloroform, etc. 88888. 99999 Chemical Reactions The reaction of carboxylic acids are classified as follows: 8. 9. 1 Reactions Acidity Involving Reactions with metals and alkalies Cleavage of The carboxylic acids like alcohols evolve hydrogen with electropositive O H Bond metals and form salts with alkalies similar to phenols. However, unlike phenols they react with weaker bases such as carbonates and hydrogencarbonates to evolve carbon dioxide. This reaction is used to detect the presence of carboxyl group in an organic compound. Carboxylic acids dissociate in water to give resonance stabilised carboxylate anions and hydronium ion. 249 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids Reprint 2025 - 26 For the above reaction: where K, is equilibrium constant and K is the acid dissociation eq a constant. For convenience, the strength of an acid is generally indicated by its Pk value rather than its K value. A a Pk = log K a a The Pk of hydrochloric acid is 7. 0, where as Pk of trifluoroacetic a a acid(the strongest carboxylic acid), benzoic acid and acetic acid are 0. 23, 4. 19 and 4. 76, respectively. Smaller the Pk, the stronger the acid(the better it is as a proton a donor). Strong acids have Pk values < 1, the acids with Pk values a a between 1 and 5 are considered to be moderately strong acids, weak acids have Pk values between 5 and 15, and extremely weak acids a have Pk values > 15. A Carboxylic acids are weaker than mineral acids, but they are stronger acids than alcohols and many simple phenols(Pk is ~ 16 for ethanol a and 10 for phenol). In fact, carboxylic acids are amongst the most acidic organic compounds you have studied so far. You already know why phenols are more acidic than alcohols. The higher acidity of carboxylic acids as compared to phenols can be understood similarly. The conjugate base of carboxylic acid, a carboxylate ion, is stabilised by two equivalent resonance structures in which the negative charge is at the more electronegative oxygen atom. The conjugate base of phenol, a phenoxide ion, has non - equivalent resonance structures in which the negative charge is at the less electronegative carbon atom. Therefore, resonance in phenoxide ion is not as important as it is in carboxylate ion. Further, the negative charge is delocalised over two electronegative oxygen atoms in carboxylate ion whereas it is less effectively delocalised over one oxygen atom and less electronegative carbon atoms in phenoxide ion(Unit 7, Class XII). Thus, the carboxylate ion is more stabilised than phenoxide ion, so carboxylic acids are more acidic than phenols. Effect of substituents on the acidity of carboxylic acids: Substituents may affect the stability of the conjugate base and thus, also affect the acidity of the carboxylic acids. Electron withdrawing groups increase the acidity of carboxylic acids by stabilising the conjugate base through delocalisation of the negative charge by inductive and / or resonance effects. Conversely, electron donating groups decrease the acidity by destabilising the conjugate base. Electron withdrawing group(EWG) Electron donating group(EDG) stabilises the carboxylate anion destabilises the carboxylate and strengthens the acid anion and weakens the acid Chemistry 250 Reprint 2025 - 26 The effect of the following groups in increasing acidity order is Ph < I < Br < Cl < F < CN < NO < CF 2 3 Thus, the following acids are arranged in order of increasing acidity(based on Pk values): a CF COOH > Ccl COOH > CHCl COOH > NO CH COOH > NC - CH COOH > 3 3 2 2 2 2 FCH COOH > ClCH COOH > BrCH COOH > HCOOH > ClCH CH COOH > 2 2 2 2 2(continue) C H COOH > C H CH COOH > CH COOH > CH CH COOH 6 5 6 5 2 3 3 2(continue) Direct attachment of groups such as phenyl or vinyl to the carboxylic acid, increases the acidity of corresponding carboxylic acid, contrary to the decrease expected due to resonance effect shown below: This is because of greater electronegativity of sp2 hybridised carbon to which carboxyl carbon is attached. The presence of electron withdrawing group on the phenyl of aromatic carboxylic acid increases their acidity while electron donating groups decrease their acidity.

Formation of anhydride Involving Carboxylic acids on heating with mineral acids such as H SO or with 2 4 Cleavage of P O give corresponding anhydride. 2 5 C OH Bond 2. Esterification Carboxylic acids are esterified with alcohols or phenols in the presence of a mineral acid such as concentrated H SO or Hcl gas as a catalyst. 2 4 251 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids Reprint 2025 - 26 Mechanism of esterification of carboxylic acids: The esterification of carboxylic acids with alcohols is a kind of nucleophilic acyl substitution. Protonation of the carbonyl oxygen activates the carbonyl group towards nucleophilic addition of the alcohol. Proton transfer in the tetrahedral intermediate converts the hydroxyl group into + OH group, which, being a better leaving group, is eliminated as neutral water 2 molecule. The protonated ester so formed finally loses a proton to give the ester. 3. Reactions with Pcl, Pcl and SOCl 5 3 2 The hydroxyl group of carboxylic acids, behaves like that of alcohols and is easily replaced by chlorine atom on treating with Pcl, Pcl or 5 3 SOCl. Thionyl chloride(SOCl) is preferred because the other two 2 2 products are gaseous and escape the reaction mixture making the purification of the products easier. 4. Reaction with ammonia Carboxylic acids react with ammonia to give ammonium salt which on further heating at high temperature give amides. For example: Chemistry 252 Reprint 2025 - 26 8. 9. 3 Reactions 1. Reduction Involving Carboxylic acids are reduced to primary alcohols by lithium COOH aluminium hydride or better with diborane. Diborane does not easily Group reduce functional groups such as ester, nitro, halo, etc. Sodium borohydride does not reduce the carboxyl group. 2. Decarboxylation Carboxylic acids lose carbon dioxide to form hydrocarbons when their sodium salts are heated with sodalime(NaOH and Cao in the ratio of 3: 1). The reaction is known as decarboxylation. Alkali metal salts of carboxylic acids also undergo decarboxylation on electrolysis of their aqueous solutions and form hydrocarbons having twice the number of carbon atoms present in the alkyl group of the acid. The reaction is known as Kolbe electrolysis(Unit 9, Class XI). 8. 9. 4 Substitution 1. Halogenation Reactions in the Carboxylic acids having an - hydrogen are halogenated at the Hydrocarbon Part - position on treatment with chlorine or bromine in the presence of small amount of red phosphorus to give - halocarboxylic acids. The reaction is known as Hell - Volhard - Zelinsky reaction. 253 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids Reprint 2025 - 26 2. Ring substitution Aromatic carboxylic acids undergo electrophilic substitution reactions in which the carboxyl group acts as a deactivating and meta - directing group. They however, do not undergo Friedel - Crafts reaction(because the carboxyl group is deactivating and the catalyst aluminium chloride(Lewis acid) gets bonded to the carboxyl group). Intext Question 8. 8 Which acid of each pair shown here would you expect to be stronger?(i) CH CO H or CH FCO H(ii) CH FCO H or CH ClCO H 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2(i) CH FCH CH CO H or CH CHFCH CO H 2 2 2 2 3 2 2(iv) 88888. 1111100000 Uses of Methanoic acid is used in rubber, textile, dyeing, leather and electroplating Carboxylic industries. Ethanoic acid is used as solvent and as vinegar in food industry. Hexanedioic acid is used in the manufacture of nylon - 6, 6. Esters of benzoic Acids acid are used in perfumery. Sodium benzoate is used as a food preservative. Higher fatty acids are used for the manufacture of soaps and detergents. Sumary Aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids are some of the important classes of organic compounds containing carbonyl group. These are highly polar molecules. Therefore, they boil at higher temperatures than the hydrocarbons and weakly polar compounds such as ethers of comparable molecular masses. The lower members are more soluble in water because they form hydrogen bonds with water. The higher members, because of large size of hydrophobic chain of carbon atoms, are insoluble in water but soluble in common organic solvents. Aldehydes are prepared by dehydrogenation or controlled oxidation of primary alcohols and controlled or selective reduction of acyl halides. Aromatic aldehydes may also be prepared by oxidation of(i) methylbenzene with chromyl chloride or Cro in the 3 presence of acetic anhydride,(ii) formylation of arenes with carbon monoxide and hydrochloric acid in the presence of anhydrous aluminium chloride, and(i) cuprous chloride or by hydrolysis of benzal chloride. Ketones are prepared by oxidation of secondary alcohols and hydration of alkynes. Ketones are also prepared by reaction of acyl chloride with dialkylcadmium. A good method for the preparation of aromatic ketones is the Friedel - Crafts acylation of aromatic hydrocarbons with acyl chlorides or anhydrides. Both aldehydes and ketones can be prepared by ozonolysis of alkenes. Aldehydes and ketones undergo nucleophilic addition reactions onto the carbonyl group with a number of nucleophiles such as, HCN, NaHSO, alcohols(or diols), 3 Chemistry 254 Reprint 2025 - 26 ammonia derivatives, and Grignard reagents. The a - hydrogens in aldehydes and ketones are acidic. Therefore, aldehydes and ketones having at least one a - hydrogen, undergo Aldol condensation in the presence of a base to give a - hydroxyaldehydes(aldol) and a - hydroxyketones(ketol), respectively. Aldehydes having no a - hydrogen undergo Cannizzaro reaction in the presence of concentrated alkali. Aldehydes and ketones are reduced to alcohols with NaBH, Lialh, or by catalytic hydrogenation. 4 4 The carbonyl group of aldehydes and ketones can be reduced to a methylene group by Clemmensen reduction or Wolff - Kishner reduction. Aldehydes are easily oxidised to carboxylic acids by mild oxidising reagents such as Tollens reagent and Fehling s reagent. These oxidation reactions are used to distinguish aldehydes from ketones. Carboxylic acids are prepared by the oxidation of primary alcohols, aldehydes and alkenes by hydrolysis of nitriles, and by treatment of Grignard reagents with carbon dioxide. Aromatic carboxylic acids are also prepared by side - chain oxidation of alkylbenzenes. Carboxylic acids are considerably more acidic than alcohols and most of simple phenols. Carboxylic acids are reduced to primary alcohols with Lialh, 4 or better with diborane in ether solution and also undergo a - halogenation with Cl 2 and Br in the presence of red phosphorus(Hell - Volhard Zelinsky reaction). 2 Methanal, ethanal, propanone, benzaldehyde, formic acid, acetic acid and benzoic acid are highly useful compounds in industry.

AMINES\nAmines can be considered as derivatives of ammonia,\nobtained by replacement of one, two or all the three\nhydrogen atoms by alkyl and/or aryl groups.\nFor example:\n99999.....11111 SSSSStttttrrrrruuuuuccccctttttuuuuurrrrreeeee ooooofffff AAAAAmmmmmiiiiinnnnneeeeesssss Like ammonia, nitrogen atom of amines is trivalent and\ncarries an unshared pair of electrons. Nitrogen orbitals\nin amines are therefore, sp3 hybridised and the geometry\nof amines is pyramidal. Each of the three sp3 hybridised\norbitals of nitrogen overlap with orbitals of hydrogen or\ncarbon depending upon the composition of the amines.\nThe fourth orbital of nitrogen in all amines contains an\nunshared pair of electrons. Due to the presence of\nunshared pair of electrons, the angle C–N–E, (where E is\nReprint 2025-26\nC or H) is less than 109.5°; for instance, it is 108o in case of\ntrimethylamine as shown in Fig. 9.1.\nFig. 9.1 Pyramidal shape of trimethylamine\n99999.....22222 CCCCClllllaaaaassssssssssiiiiifffffiiiiicccccaaaaatttttiiiiiooooonnnnn Amines are classified as primary (1o), secondary (2o) and tertiary (3o)\ndepending upon the number of hydrogen atoms replaced by alkyl or\naryl groups in ammonia molecule. If one hydrogen atom of ammonia\nis replaced by R or Ar , we get RNH or ArNH , a primary amine (1o).\n2 2\nIf two hydrogen atoms of ammonia or one hydrogen atom of R-NH are\n2\nreplaced by another alkyl/aryl(R’) group, what would you get? You\nget R-NHR’, secondary amine. The second alkyl/aryl group may be\nsame or different. Replacement of another hydrogen atom by alkyl/aryl\ngroup leads to the formation of tertiary amine. Amines are said to be\n‘simple’ when all the alkyl or aryl groups are the same, and ‘mixed’\nwhen they are different.\n99999.....33333 NNNNNooooommmmmeeeeennnnnccccclllllaaaaatttttuuuuurrrrreeeee In common system, an aliphatic amine is named by prefixing alkyl\ngroup to amine, i.e., alkylamine as one word (e.g., methylamine). In\nsecondary and tertiary amines, when two or more groups are the same,\nthe prefix di or tri is appended before the name of alkyl group. In\nIUPAC system, primary amines are named as alkanamines. The name\nis derived by replacement of ‘e’ of alkane by the word amine. For\nexample, CH NH is named as methanamine. In case, more than one\n3 2\namino group is present at different positions in the parent chain, their\npositions are specified by giving numbers to the carbon atoms bearing\n–NH groups and suitable prefix such as di, tri, etc. is attached to the\n2\namine. The letter ‘e’ of the suffix of the hydrocarbon part is retained. For\nexample, H N–CH –CH –NH is named as ethane-1, 2-diamine.\n2 2 2 2\nTo name secondary and tertiary amines, we use locant N to designate\nsubstituent attached to a nitrogen atom. For example, CH NHCH CH is\n3 2 3\nChemistry 260\nReprint 2025-26\nnamed as N-methylethanamine and (CH CH ) N is named as N, N-\n3 2 3\ndiethylethanamine. More examples are given in Table 9.1.\nIn arylamines, –NH group is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n2\nC H NH is the simplest example of arylamine. In common system, it\n6 5 2\nis known as aniline. It is also an accepted IUPAC name. While naming\narylamines according to IUPAC system, suffix ‘e’ of arene is replaced by\n‘amine’. Thus in IUPAC system, C H –NH is named as benzenamine.\n6 5 2\nCommon and IUPAC names of some alkylamines and arylamines are\ngiven in Table 9.1.\nTable 9.1: Nomenclature of Some Alkylamines and Arylamines\nAmine Common name IUPAC name\nCH –CH –NH Ethylamine Ethanamine\n3- 2 2\nCH –CH –CH –NH n-Propylamine Propan-1-amine\n3 2 2 2\nIsopropylamine Propan-2-amine\nEthylmethylamine N-Methylethanamine\nTrimethylamine N,N-Dimethylmethanamine\nN,N-Diethylbutylamine N,N-Diethylbutan-1-amine\nAllylamine Prop-2-en-1-amine\nHexamethylenediamine Hexane-1,6-diamine\nAniline Aniline or Benzenamine\no-Toluidine 2-Methylaniline\np-Bromoaniline 4-Bromobenzenamine\nor\n4-Bromoaniline\nN,N-Dimethylaniline N,N-Dimethylbenzenamine\n261 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n9.1 Classify the following amines as primary, secondary or tertiary:\n9.2 (i) Write structures of different isomeric amines corresponding to the molecular\nformula, C H N.\n4 11\n(ii) Write IUPAC names of all the isomers.\n(iii) What type of isomerism is exhibited by different pairs of amines?\n99999.....44444 PPPPPrrrrreeeeepppppaaaaarrrrraaaaatttttiiiiiooooonnnnn Amines are prepared by the following methods:\nooooofffff AAAAAmmmmmiiiiinnnnneeeeesssss\n1. Reduction of nitro compounds\nNitro compounds are reduced to amines by passing hydrogen gas\nin the presence of finely divided nickel, palladium or platinum and\nalso by reduction with metals in acidic medium. Nitroalkanes can\nalso be similarly reduced to the corresponding alkanamines.\nReduction with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid is preferred because\nFeCl formed gets hydrolysed to release hydrochloric acid during the\n2\nreaction. Thus, only a small amount of hydrochloric acid is required\nto initiate the reaction.\n2. Ammonolysis of alkyl halides\nYou have read (Unit 6, Class XII) that the carbon - halogen bond in\nalkyl or benzyl halides can be easily cleaved by a nucleophile. Hence,\nan alkyl or benzyl halide on reaction with an ethanolic solution of\nammonia undergoes nucleophilic substitution reaction in which the\nhalogen atom is replaced by an amino (–NH ) group. This process of\n2\ncleavage of the C–X bond by ammonia molecule is known as\nammonolysis. The reaction is carried out in a sealed tube at 373\nK. The primary amine thus obtained behaves as a nucleophile and\ncan further react with alkyl halide to form secondary and tertiary\namines, and finally quaternary ammonium salt.\nChemistry 262\nReprint 2025-26\nThe free amine can be obtained from the ammonium salt by treatment\nwith a strong base:\nAmmonolysis has the disadvantage of yielding a mixture of primary,\nsecondary and tertiary amines and also a quaternary ammonium salt.\nHowever, primary amine is obtained as a major product by taking\nlarge excess of ammonia.\nThe order of reactivity of halides with amines is RI > RBr >RCl.\nWrite chemical equations for the following reactions: EEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 99999.....11111\n(i) Reaction of ethanolic NH with C H Cl.\n3 2 5\n(ii) Ammonolysis of benzyl chloride and reaction of amine so formed\nwith two moles of CH Cl.\n3\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\n3. Reduction of nitriles\nNitriles on reduction with lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH ) or\n4\ncatalytic hydrogenation produce primary amines.

Gabriel phthalimide synthesis\nGabriel synthesis is used for the preparation of primary amines.\nPhthalimide on treatment with ethanolic potassium hydroxide forms\npotassium salt of phthalimide which on heating with alkyl halide\nfollowed by alkaline hydrolysis produces the corresponding primary\namine. Aromatic primary amines cannot be prepared by this method\nbecause aryl halides do not undergo nucleophilic substitution with\nthe anion formed by phthalimide.\n6. Hoffmann bromamide degradation reaction\nHoffmann developed a method for preparation of primary amines by\ntreating an amide with bromine in an aqueous or ethanolic solution\nof sodium hydroxide. In this degradation reaction, migration of an\nalkyl or aryl group takes place from carbonyl carbon of the amide\nto the nitrogen atom.

Aniline and other arylamines are usually colourless but get\ncoloured on storage due to atmospheric oxidation.\nLower aliphatic amines are soluble in water because they can form\nhydrogen bonds with water molecules. However, solubility decreases\nwith increase in molar mass of amines due to increase in size of the\nhydrophobic alkyl part. Higher amines are essentially insoluble in water.\nConsidering the electronegativity of nitrogen of amine and oxygen of\nalcohol as 3.0 and 3.5 respectively, you can predict the pattern of\nsolubility of amines and alcohols in water. Out of butan-1-ol and\nbutan-1-amine, which will be more soluble in water and why? Amines\nare soluble in organic solvents like alcohol, ether and benzene. You\nmay remember that alcohols are more polar than amines and form\nstronger intermolecular hydrogen bonds than amines.\nPrimary and secondary amines are engaged in intermolecular\nassociation due to hydrogen bonding between nitrogen of one and\nhydrogen of another molecule. This intermolecular association is more\nin primary amines than in secondary amines as there are two hydrogen\natoms available for hydrogen bond formation in it. Tertiary amines do\nnot have intermolecular association due to the absence of hydrogen\natom available for hydrogen bond formation. Therefore, the order of\nboiling points of isomeric amines is as follows:\n265 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\nPrimary > Secondary > Tertiary\nIntermolecular hydrogen bonding in primary amines is shown in\nFig. 9.2.\nFig. 9.2 Intermolecular hydrogen bonding in primary amines\nBoiling points of amines, alcohols and alkanes of almost the same\nmolar mass are shown in Table 9.2.\nTable 9.2: Comparison of Boiling Points of Amines, Alcohols and\nAlkanes of Similar Molecular Masses\nSl.

The number of hydrogen atoms attached to nitrogen\natom also decides the course of reaction of amines; that is why primary\n(–NH ), secondary N H and tertiary amines N differ in many\n2\nreactions. Moreover, amines behave as nucleophiles due to the presence\nof unshared electron pair. Some of the reactions of amines are described\nbelow:\n1. Basic character of amines\nAmines, being basic in nature, react with acids to form salts.\nChemistry 266\nReprint 2025-26\nAmine salts on treatment with a base like NaOH, regenerate the\nparent amine.\nAmine salts are soluble in water but insoluble in organic solvents\nlike ether. This reaction is the basis for the separation of amines from\nthe non basic organic compounds insoluble in water.\nThe reaction of amines with mineral acids to form ammonium salts\nshows that these are basic in nature. Amines have an unshared pair\nof electrons on nitrogen atom due to which they behave as Lewis base.\nBasic character of amines can be better understood in terms of their K\nb\nand pK values as explained below:\nb\n   \nRNH OH\n3\nK =\nR NH H O\n2 2\n   \nR NH OH\nor K[H O] = 3\n2 RNH \n2\n   \nR NH OH\nor K = 3\nb R NH \n2\npK = –log K\nb b\nLarger the value of K or smaller the value of pK , stronger is the\nb b\nbase. The pK values of few amines are given in Table 9.3.\nb\npK value of ammonia is 4.75. Aliphatic amines are stronger bases\nb\nthan ammonia due to +I effect of alkyl groups leading to high electron\ndensity on the nitrogen atom. Their pK values lie in the range of 3 to\nb\n4.22. On the other hand, aromatic amines are weaker bases than\nammonia due to the electron withdrawing nature of the aryl group.\nTable 9.3: pK Values of Amines in Aqueous Phase\nb\nName of amine pK\nb\nMethanamine 3.38\nN-Methylmethanamine 3.27\nN,N-Dimethylmethanamine 4.22\nEthanamine 3.29\nN-Ethylethanamine 3.00\nN,N-Diethylethanamine 3.25\nBenzenamine 9.38\nPhenylmethanamine 4.70\nN-Methylaniline 9.30\nN,N-Dimethylaniline 8.92\n267 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\nYou may find some discrepancies while trying to interpret the K\nb\nvalues of amines on the basis of +I or –I effect of the substituents\npresent in amines. Besides inductive effect, there are other effects like\nsolvation effect, steric hinderance, etc., which affect the basic strength\nof amines. Just ponder over. You may get the answer in the following\nparagraphs.\nStructure-basicity relationship of amines\nBasicity of amines is related to their structure. Basic character of\nan amine depends upon the ease of formation of the cation by\naccepting a proton from the acid. The more stable the cation is\nrelative to the amine, more basic is the amine.\n(a)Alkanamines versus ammonia\nLet us consider the reaction of an alkanamine and ammonia with\na proton to compare their basicity.\nDue to the electron releasing nature of alkyl group, it pushes\nelectrons towards nitrogen and thus makes the unshared electron\npair more available for sharing with the proton of the acid. Moreover,\nthe substituted ammonium ion formed from the amine gets stabilised\ndue to dispersal of the positive charge by the +I effect of the alkyl\ngroup. Hence, alkylamines are stronger bases than ammonia.\nThus, the basic nature of aliphatic amines should increase with\nincrease in the number of alkyl groups. This trend is followed in\nthe gaseous phase. The order of basicity of amines in the gaseous\nphase follows the expected order: tertiary amine > secondary amine\n> primary amine > NH . The trend is not regular in the aqueous\nstate as evident by th 3 eir pK values given in Table 9.3. In the\nb\naqueous phase, the substituted ammonium cations get stabilised\nnot only by electron releasing effect of the alkyl group (+I) but also\nby solvation with water molecules. The greater the size of the ion,\nlesser will be the solvation and the less stabilised is the ion. The\norder of stability of ions are as follows:\nDecreasing order of extent of H-bonding in water and order of\nstability of ions by solvation.\nChemistry 268\nReprint 2025-26\nGreater is the stability of the substituted ammonium cation, stronger\nshould be the corresponding amine as a base. Thus, the order of basicity\nof aliphatic amines should be: primary > secondary > tertiary, which\nis opposite to the inductive effect based order. Secondly, when the\nalkyl group is small, like –CH group, there is no steric hindrance to\n3\nH-bonding. In case the alkyl group is bigger than CH group, there will\n3\nbe steric hinderance to H-bonding. Therefore, the change of nature of\nthe alkyl group, e.g., from –CH to –C H results in change of the order\n3 2 5\nof basic strength. Thus, there is a subtle interplay of the inductive\neffect, solvation effect and steric hinderance of the alkyl group which\ndecides the basic strength of alkyl amines in the aqueous state. The\norder of basic strength in case of methyl substituted amines and ethyl\nsubstituted amines in aqueous solution is as follows:\n(C H ) NH > (C H ) N > C H NH > NH\n2 5 2 2 5 3 2 5 2 3\n(CH ) NH > CH NH > (CH ) N > NH\n3 2 3 2 3 3 3\n(b) Arylamines versus ammonia\npK value of aniline is quite high. Why is it so? It is because in\nb\naniline or other arylamines, the -NH group is attached directly to\n2\nthe benzene ring. It results in the unshared electron pair on nitrogen\natom to be in conjugation with the benzene ring and thus making\nit less available for protonation. If you write different resonating\nstructures of aniline, you will find that aniline is a resonance\nhybrid of the following five structures.\nOn the other hand, anilinium ion obtained by accepting a proton\ncan have only two resonating structures (kekule).\nWe know that greater the number of resonating structures, greater\nis the stability. Thus you can infer that aniline (five resonating\nstructures) is more stable than anilinium ion. Hence, the proton\nacceptability or the basic nature of aniline or other aromatic amines\nwould be less than that of ammonia. In case of substituted aniline, it\nis observed that electron releasing groups like –OCH , –CH increase\n3 3\nbasic strength whereas electron withdrawing groups like –NO , –SO H,\n2 3\n–COOH, –X decrease it.\n269 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 99999.....44444\nArrange the following in decreasing order of their basic strength:\nC H NH , C H NH , (C H ) NH, NH\n6 5 2 2 5 2 2 52 3\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn The decreasing order of basic strength of the above amines and ammonia\nfollows the following order:\n(C H ) NH > C H NH > NH > C H NH\n2 52 2 5 2 3 6 5 2\n2.Alkylation\nAmines undergo alkylation on reaction with alkyl halides (refer Unit\n6, Class XII).\n3.Acylation\nAliphatic and aromatic primary and secondary amines react with\nacid chlorides, anhydrides and esters by nucleophilic substitution\nreaction. This reaction is known as acylation. You can consider\nthis reaction as the replacement of hydrogen atom of –NH or >N–H\n2\ngroup by the acyl group. The products obtained by acylation reaction\nare known as amides. The reaction is carried out in the presence of\na base stronger than the amine, like pyridine, which removes HCl so\nformed and shifts the equilibrium to the right hand side.\nAmines also react with benzoyl chloride (C H COCl). This reaction\n6 5\nis known as benzoylation.\nCH NH  C H COCl  CH NHCOC H HCl\n3 2 6 5 3 6 5\nMethanamine Benzoyl chloride NMethylbenzamide\nWhat do you think is the product of the reaction of amines with\ncarboxylic acids ? They form salts with amines at room temperature.\nChemistry 270\nReprint 2025-26\n4. Carbylamine reaction\nAliphatic and aromatic primary amines on heating with chloroform\nand ethanolic potassium hydroxide form isocyanides or carbylamines\nwhich are foul smelling substances. Secondary and tertiary amines\ndo not show this reaction. This reaction is known as carbylamine\nreaction or isocyanide test and is used as a test for primary amines.\n5. Reaction with nitrous acid\nThree classes of amines react differently with nitrous acid which is\nprepared in situ from a mineral acid and sodium nitrite.\n(a) Primary aliphatic amines react with nitrous acid to form aliphatic\ndiazonium salts which being unstable, liberate nitrogen gas\nquantitatively and alcohols. Quantitative evolution of nitrogen is\nused in estimation of amino acids and proteins.\n(b) Aromatic amines react with nitrous acid at low temperatures\n(273-278 K) to form diazonium salts, a very important class of\ncompounds used for synthesis of a variety of aromatic compounds\ndiscussed in Section 9.7.\nSecondary and tertiary amines react with nitrous acid in a\ndifferent manner.\n6. Reaction with arylsulphonyl chloride\nBenzenesulphonyl chloride (C H SO Cl), which is also known as\n6 5 2\nHinsberg’s reagent, reacts with primary and secondary amines to\nform sulphonamides.\n(a)The reaction of benzenesulphonyl chloride with primary amine\nyields N-ethylbenzenesulphonyl amide.\nThe hydrogen attached to nitrogen in sulphonamide is strongly\nacidic due to the presence of strong electron withdrawing sulphonyl\ngroup. Hence, it is soluble in alkali.\n(b) In the reaction with secondary amine, N,N-diethyl-\nbenzenesulphonamide is formed.\nO O\nS Cl + H N C H S N C H + HCl\n2 5 2 5\nO C H O C H\n2 5 2 5\nN,N-Diethylbenzenesulphonamide\n271 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\nSince N, N-diethylbenzene sulphonamide does not contain any\nhydrogen atom attached to nitrogen atom, it is not acidic and hence\ninsoluble in alkali.\n(c) Tertiary amines do not react with benzenesulphonyl chloride.\nThis property of amines reacting with benzenesulphonyl chloride\nin a different manner is used for the distinction of primary,\nsecondary and tertiary amines and also for the separation of a\nmixture of amines. However, these days benzenesulphonyl\nchloride is replaced by p-toluenesulphonyl chloride.\n7. Electrophilic substitution\nYou have read earlier that aniline is a resonance hybrid of five\nstructures. Where do you find the maximum electron density in\nthese structures? Ortho- and para-positions to the –NH group\n2\nbecome centres of high electron density. Thus –NH group is ortho\n2\nand para directing and a powerful activating group.\n(a) Bromination: Aniline reacts with bromine water at room\ntemperature to give a white precipitate of 2,4,6-tribromoaniline.\nThe main problem encountered during electrophilic substitution\nreactions of aromatic amines is that of their very high reactivity.\nSubstitution tends to occur at ortho- and para-positions. If we\nhave to prepare monosubstituted aniline derivative, how can\nthe activating effect of –NH group be controlled ? This can be\n2\ndone by protecting the -NH group by acetylation with acetic\n2\nanhydride, then carrying out the desired substitution followed\nby hydrolysis of the substituted amide to the substituted amine.\nThe lone pair of electrons on nitrogen of acetanilide interacts\nwith oxygen atom due to resonance as shown below:\nChemistry 272\nReprint 2025-26\nHence, the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen is less available for\ndonation to benzene ring by resonance. Therefore, activating\neffect of –NHCOCH group is less than that of amino group.\n3\n(b) Nitration: Direct nitration of aniline yields tarry oxidation\nproducts in addition to the nitro derivatives. Moreover, in the\nstrongly acidic medium, aniline is protonated to form the\nanilinium ion which is meta directing. That is why besides the\northo and para derivatives, significant amount of meta derivative\nis also formed.\nHowever, by protecting the –NH group by acetylation reaction\n2\nwith acetic anhydride, the nitration reaction can be controlled\nand the p-nitro derivative can be obtained as the major product.\n(c) Sulphonation: Aniline reacts with concentrated sulphuric acid\nto form anilinium hydrogensulphate which on heating with\nsulphuric acid at 453-473K produces p-aminobenzene sulphonic\nacid, commonly known as sulphanilic acid, as the major product.\nAniline does not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction (alkylation and\nacetylation) due to salt formation with aluminium chloride, the\nLewis acid, which is used as a catalyst. Due to this, nitrogen of\naniline acquires positive charge and hence acts as a strong\ndeactivating group for further reaction.\n273 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n9.4 Arrange the following in increasing order of their basic strength:\n(i) C H NH , C H NH , NH , C H CH NH and (C H ) NH\n2 5 2 6 5 2 3 6 5 2 2 2 5 2\n(ii) C H NH , (C H ) NH, (C H ) N, C H NH\n2 5 2 2 5 2 2 5 3 6 5 2\n(iii) CH NH , (CH ) NH, (CH ) N, C H NH , C H CH NH .\n3 2 32 33 6 5 2 6 5 2 2\n9.5 Complete the following acid-base reactions and name the products:\n(i) CH CH CH NH + HCl fi (ii) (C H ) N + HCl fi\n3 2 2 2 2 5 3\n9.6 Write reactions of the final alkylation product of aniline with excess of methyl\niodide in the presence of sodium carbonate solution.\n9.7 Write chemical reaction of aniline with benzoyl chloride and write the name of\nthe product obtained.\n9.8 Write structures of different isomers corresponding to the molecular formula,\nC H N. Write IUPAC names of the isomers which will liberate nitrogen gas on\n3 9\ntreatment with nitrous acid.\nII. DIAZONIUM SALTS\n –\nThe diazonium salts have the general formula RN X where R stands\n2\nfor an aryl group and X – ion may be Cl– Br,– HSO, BF, etc. They are\n4 4\nnamed by suffixing diazonium to the name of the parent hydrocarbon\nfrom which they are formed, followed by the name of anion such as\n\nchloride, hydrogensulphate, etc. The N group is called diazonium\n2\n –\ngroup. For example, C H N Cl is named as benzenediazonium\n6 5 2\nchloride and C H N +HSO – is known as benzenediazonium\n6 5 2 4\nhydrogensulphate.\nPrimary aliphatic amines form highly unstable alkyldiazonium salts\n(refer to Section 9.6). Primary aromatic amines form arenediazonium\nsalts which are stable for a short time in solution at low temperatures\n(273-278 K). The stability of arenediazonium ion is explained on the\nbasis of resonance.\n99999.....77777 MMMMMeeeeettttthhhhhoooooddddd ooooofffff Benzenediazonium chloride is prepared by the reaction of aniline with\nnitrous acid at 273-278K.

Reactions involving displacement of nitrogen\nDiazonium group being a very good leaving group, is substituted\nby other groups such as Cl–, Br– I– CN– and OH– which displace\n, ,\nnitrogen from the aromatic ring. The nitrogen formed escapes from\nthe reaction mixture as a gas.\n1. Replacement by halide or cyanide ion: The Cl–, Br– and CN–\nnucleophiles can easily be introduced in the benzene ring in the\npresence of Cu(I) ion. This reaction is called Sandmeyer reaction.\n2 2\n2 2\nAlternatively, chlorine or bromine can also be introduced in the\nbenzene ring by treating the diazonium salt solution with corresponding\nhalogen acid in the presence of copper powder. This is referred as\nGatterman reaction.\nThe yield in Sandmeyer reaction is found to be better than\nGattermann reaction.\n2. Replacement by iodide ion: Iodine is not easily introduced into\nthe benzene ring directly, but, when the diazonium salt solution\nis treated with potassium iodide, iodobenzene is formed.\n3. Replacement by fluoride ion: When arenediazonium chloride is\ntreated with fluoroboric acid, arene diazonium fluoroborate is\nprecipitated which on heating decomposes to yield aryl fluoride.\n4. Replacement by H: Certain mild reducing agents like\nhypophosphorous acid (phosphinic acid) or ethanol reduce\ndiazonium salts to arenes and themselves get oxidised to\nphosphorous acid and ethanal, respectively.\n275 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\n5. Replacement by hydroxyl group: If the temperature of the\ndiazonium salt solution is allowed to rise upto 283 K, the salt\ngets hydrolysed to phenol.\n6. Replacement by –NO group: When diazonium fluoroborate is\n2\nheated with aqueous sodium nitrite solution in the presence of\ncopper, the diazonium group is replaced by –NO group.\n2\nB. Reactions involving retention of diazo group\ncoupling reactions\nThe azo products obtained have an extended conjugate system having\nboth the aromatic rings joined through the –N=N– bond. These compounds\nare often coloured and are used as dyes. Benzene diazonium chloride\nreacts with phenol in which the phenol molecule at its para position is\ncoupled with the diazonium salt to formp-hydroxyazobenzene. This\ntype of reaction is known as coupling reaction. Similarly the reaction of\ndiazonium salt with aniline yields p-aminoazobenzene. This is an example\nof electrophilic substitution reaction.\n99999.....1111100000 IIIIImmmmmpppppooooorrrrrtttttaaaaannnnnccccceeeee From the above reactions, it is clear that the diazonium salts are very\ngood intermediates for the introduction of –F, –Cl, –Br, –I, –CN, –OH,\nooooofffff DDDDDiiiiiaaaaazzzzzooooonnnnniiiiiuuuuummmmm\n–NO groups into the aromatic ring.\nSSSSSaaaaallllltttttsssss iiiiinnnnn 2\nAryl fluorides and iodides cannot be prepared by direct halogenation.\nSSSSSyyyyynnnnnttttthhhhheeeeesssssiiiiisssss The cyano group cannot be introduced by nucleophilic substitution of\nooooofffff AAAAArrrrrooooommmmmaaaaatttttiiiiiccccc chlorine in chlorobenzene but cyanobenzene can be easily obtained\nfrom diazonium salt.\nCCCCCooooommmmmpppppooooouuuuunnnnndddddsssss\nThus, the replacement of diazo group by other groups is helpful in\nChemistry 276\nReprint 2025-26\npreparing those substituted aromatic compounds which cannot be\nprepared by direct substitution in benzene or substituted benzene.\nHow will you convert 4-nitrotoluene to 2-bromobenzoic acid ?

Replacement of one hydrogen atom of\nammonia gives rise to structure of the type R-NH , known as primary amine.\n2\nSecondary amines are characterised by the structure R NH or R-NHR¢¢¢¢¢ and tertiary\n2\namines by R N, RNR¢¢¢¢¢R¢¢¢¢¢¢¢¢¢¢ or R NR¢¢¢¢¢..... Secondary and tertiary amines are known as\n3 2\nsimple amines if the alkyl or aryl groups are the same and mixed amines if the\ngroups are different. Like ammonia, all the three types of amines have one unshared\nelectron pair on nitrogen atom due to which they behave as Lewis bases.\nAmines are usually formed from nitro compounds, halides, amides, imides, etc.\nThey exhibit hydrogen bonding which influence their physical properties. In\nalkylamines, a combination of electron releasing, steric and H-bonding factors\ninfluence the stability of the substituted ammonium cations in protic polar solvents\nand thus affect the basic nature of amines. Alkyl amines are found to be stronger\nbases than ammonia. In aromatic amines, electron releasing and withdrawing groups,\nrespectively increase and decrease their basic character. Aniline is a weaker base\n277 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\nthan ammonia. Reactions of amines are governed by availability of the unshared pair\nof electrons on nitrogen. Influence of the number of hydrogen atoms at nitrogen atom\non the type of reactions and nature of products is responsible for identification and\ndistinction between primary, secondary and tertiary amines. p-Toluenesulphonyl chloride\nis used for the identification of primary, secondary and tertiary amines. Presence of\namino group in aromatic ring enhances reactivity of the aromatic amines. Reactivity of\naromatic amines can be controlled by acylation process, i.e., by treating with acetyl\nchloride or acetic anhydride. Tertiary amines like trimethylamine are used as insect\nattractants.\nAryldiazonium salts, usually obtained from arylamines, undergo replacement of\nthe diazonium group with a variety of nucleophiles to provide advantageous methods\nfor producing aryl halides, cyanides, phenols and arenes by reductive removal of the\ndiazo group. Coupling reaction of aryldiazonium salts with phenols or arylamines give\nrise to the formation of azo dyes.\nExercises\n9.1 Write IUPAC names of the following compounds and classify them into primary,\nsecondary and tertiary amines.\n(i) (CH ) CHNH (ii) CH (CH ) NH (iii) CH NHCH(CH )\n32 2 3 2 2 2 3 3 2\n(iv) (CH ) CNH (v) C H NHCH (vi) (CH CH ) NCH\n3 3 2 6 5 3 3 2 2 3\n(vii) m–BrC H NH\n6 4 2\n9.2 Give one chemical test to distinguish between the following pairs of compounds.\n(i) Methylamine and dimethylamine (ii) Secondary and tertiary amines\n(iii) Ethylamine and aniline (iv) Aniline and benzylamine\n(v) Aniline and N-methylaniline.\n9.3 Account for the following:\n(i) pK of aniline is more than that of methylamine.\nb\n(ii) Ethylamine is soluble in water whereas aniline is not.\n(iii) Methylamine in water reacts with ferric chloride to precipitate hydrated\nferric oxide.\n(iv) Although amino group is o– and p– directing in aromatic electrophilic\nsubstitution reactions, aniline on nitration gives a substantial amount of\nm-nitroaniline.\n(v) Aniline does not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction.\n(vi) Diazonium salts of aromatic amines are more stable than those of aliphatic\namines.\n(vii) Gabriel phthalimide synthesis is preferred for synthesising primary amines.\n9.4 Arrange the following:\n(i) In decreasing order of the pK values:\nb\nC H NH , C H NHCH , (C H ) NH and C H NH\n2 5 2 6 5 3 2 52 6 5 2\n(ii) In increasing order of basic strength:\nC H NH , C H N(CH ) , (C H ) NH and CH NH\n6 5 2 6 5 32 2 5 2 3 2\n(iii) In increasing order of basic strength:\n(a) Aniline, p-nitroaniline and p-toluidine\nChemistry 278\nReprint 2025-26\n(b) C H NH , C H NHCH , C H CH NH .\n6 5 2 6 5 3 6 5 2 2\n(iv) In decreasing order of basic strength in gas phase:\nC H NH , (C H ) NH, (C H ) N and NH\n2 5 2 2 52 2 53 3\n(v) In increasing order of boiling point:\nC H OH, (CH ) NH, C H NH\n2 5 32 2 5 2\n(vi) In increasing order of solubility in water:\nC H NH , (C H ) NH, C H NH .\n6 5 2 2 52 2 5 2\n9.5 How will you convert:\n(i) Ethanoic acid into methanamine\n(ii) Hexanenitrile into 1-aminopentane\n(iii) Methanol to ethanoic acid\n(iv) Ethanamine into methanamine\n(v) Ethanoic acid into propanoic acid\n(vi) Methanamine into ethanamine\n(vii) Nitromethane into dimethylamine\n(viii) Propanoic acid into ethanoic acid?\n9.6 Describe a method for the identification of primary, secondary and tertiary amines.\nAlso write chemical equations of the reactions involved.\n9.7 Write short notes on the following:\n(i) Carbylamine reaction (ii) Diazotisation\n(iii) Hofmann’s bromamide reaction (iv) Coupling reaction\n(v) Ammonolysis (vi) Acetylation\n(vii) Gabriel phthalimide synthesis.\n9.8 Accomplish the following conversions:\n(i) Nitrobenzene to benzoic acid\n(ii) Benzene to m-bromophenol\n(iii) Benzoic acid to aniline\n(iv) Aniline to 2,4,6-tribromofluorobenzene\n(v) Benzyl chloride to 2-phenylethanamine\n(vi) Chlorobenzene to p-chloroaniline\n(vii) Aniline to p-bromoaniline\n(viii) Benzamide to toluene\n(ix) Aniline to benzyl alcohol.\n9.9 Give the structures of A, B and C in the following reactions:\n(i) CH CH INaCNA OH BNaOHBr 2C\n3 2 Partial hydrolysis\n(ii) C H N ClCuCNA H 2 O/H  BNH3 C\n6 5 2 \n(iii) CH CH BrKCN A LiAlH 4BHNO 2C\n3 2 0C\n(iv) C H NO Fe/HCl A NaNO 2HClBH 2 O/H  C\n6 5 2 273K \n(v) CH COOHNH3 ANaOBrBNaNO 2/HClC\n3 \n(vi) C H NO Fe/HCl A HNO 2BC 6 H5 OHC\n6 5 2 273K\n279 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\n9.10 An aromatic compound ‘A’ on treatment with aqueous ammonia and heating\nforms compound ‘B’ which on heating with Br and KOH forms a compound ‘C’\n2\nof molecular formula C H N.

Synthetic examples include polymers, describe some of the important dye stuffs and drugs. Two biologically active methods of preparation of amines; compounds, namely adrenaline and ephedrine, both explain the properties of amines; containing secondary amino group, are used to increase distinguish between primary, blood pressure. Novocain, a synthetic amino compound, secondary and tertiary amines; is used as an anaesthetic in dentistry. Benadryl, a well describe the method of prepara - known antihistaminic drug also contains tertiary amino tion of diazonium salts and their group. Quaternary ammonium salts are used as importance in the synthesis of a series of aromatic compounds surfactants. Diazonium salts are intermediates in the including azo dyes. Preparation of a variety of aromatic compounds including dyes. In this Unit, you will learn about amines and diazonium salts. I. AMINES Amines can be considered as derivatives of ammonia, obtained by replacement of one, two or all the three hydrogen atoms by alkyl and / or aryl groups. For example: 99999. 11111 Structure of Amines Like ammonia, nitrogen atom of amines is trivalent and carries an unshared pair of electrons. Nitrogen orbitals in amines are therefore, sp3 hybridised and the geometry of amines is pyramidal. Each of the three sp3 hybridised orbitals of nitrogen overlap with orbitals of hydrogen or carbon depending upon the composition of the amines. The fourth orbital of nitrogen in all amines contains an unshared pair of electrons. Due to the presence of unshared pair of electrons, the angle C N E,(where E is Reprint 2025 - 26 C or H) is less than 109. 5 °; for instance, it is 108o in case of trimethylamine as shown in Fig. 9. 1. Fig. 9. 1 Pyramidal shape of trimethylamine 99999. 22222 Clasification Amines are classified as primary(1o), secondary(2o) and tertiary(3o) depending upon the number of hydrogen atoms replaced by alkyl or aryl groups in ammonia molecule. If one hydrogen atom of ammonia is replaced by R or Ar, we get RNH or ArNH, a primary amine(1o). 2 2 If two hydrogen atoms of ammonia or one hydrogen atom of R - NH are 2 replaced by another alkyl / aryl(R) group, what would you get? You get R - NHR, secondary amine. The second alkyl / aryl group may be same or different. Replacement of another hydrogen atom by alkyl / aryl group leads to the formation of tertiary amine. Amines are said to be simple when all the alkyl or aryl groups are the same, and mixed when they are different. 99999. 33333 Nomenclature In common system, an aliphatic amine is named by prefixing alkyl group to amine, i. e., alkylamine as one word(e. g., methylamine). In secondary and tertiary amines, when two or more groups are the same, the prefix di or tri is appended before the name of alkyl group. In IUPAC system, primary amines are named as alkanamines. The name is derived by replacement of e of alkane by the word amine. For example, CH NH is named as methanamine. In case, more than one 3 2 amino group is present at different positions in the parent chain, their positions are specified by giving numbers to the carbon atoms bearing NH groups and suitable prefix such as di, tri, etc. Is attached to the 2 amine. The letter e of the suffix of the hydrocarbon part is retained. For example, H N CH CH NH is named as ethane - 1, 2 - diamine. 2 2 2 2 To name secondary and tertiary amines, we use locant N to designate substituent attached to a nitrogen atom. For example, CH NHCH CH is 3 2 3 Chemistry 260 Reprint 2025 - 26 named as N - methylethanamine and(CH CH) N is named as N, N - 3 2 3 diethylethanamine. More examples are given in Table 9. 1. In arylamines, NH group is directly attached to the benzene ring. 2 C H NH is the simplest example of arylamine. In common system, it 6 5 2 is known as aniline. It is also an accepted IUPAC name. While naming arylamines according to IUPAC system, suffix e of arene is replaced by amine. Thus in IUPAC system, C H NH is named as benzenamine. 6 5 2 Common and IUPAC names of some alkylamines and arylamines are given in Table 9. 1. Table 9. 1: Nomenclature of Some Alkylamines and Arylamines Amine Common name IUPAC name CH CH NH Ethylamine Ethanamine 3 - 2 2 CH CH CH NH n - Propylamine Propan - 1 - amine 3 2 2 2 Isopropylamine Propan - 2 - amine Ethylmethylamine N - Methylethanamine Trimethylamine N, N - Dimethylmethanamine N, N - Diethylbutylamine N, N - Diethylbutan - 1 - amine Allylamine Prop - 2 - en - 1 - amine Hexamethylenediamine Hexane - 1, 6 - diamine Aniline Aniline or Benzenamine o - Toluidine 2 - Methylaniline p - Bromoaniline 4 - Bromobenzenamine or 4 - Bromoaniline N, N - Dimethylaniline N, N - Dimethylbenzenamine 261 Amines Reprint 2025 - 26 Intext Questions 9. 1 Classify the following amines as primary, secondary or tertiary: 9. 2(i) Write structures of different isomeric amines corresponding to the molecular formula, C H N. 4 11(ii) Write IUPAC names of all the isomers.(i) What type of isomerism is exhibited by different pairs of amines? 99999. 44444 Preparation Amines are prepared by the following methods: of Amines 1. Reduction of nitro compounds Nitro compounds are reduced to amines by passing hydrogen gas in the presence of finely divided nickel, palladium or platinum and also by reduction with metals in acidic medium. Nitroalkanes can also be similarly reduced to the corresponding alkanamines. Reduction with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid is preferred because Fecl formed gets hydrolysed to release hydrochloric acid during the 2 reaction. Thus, only a small amount of hydrochloric acid is required to initiate the reaction. 2. Ammonolysis of alkyl halides You have read(Unit 6, Class XII) that the carbon - halogen bond in alkyl or benzyl halides can be easily cleaved by a nucleophile. Hence, an alkyl or benzyl halide on reaction with an ethanolic solution of ammonia undergoes nucleophilic substitution reaction in which the halogen atom is replaced by an amino(NH) group. This process of 2 cleavage of the C X bond by ammonia molecule is known as ammonolysis. The reaction is carried out in a sealed tube at 373 K. The primary amine thus obtained behaves as a nucleophile and can further react with alkyl halide to form secondary and tertiary amines, and finally quaternary ammonium salt. Chemistry 262 Reprint 2025 - 26 The free amine can be obtained from the ammonium salt by treatment with a strong base: Ammonolysis has the disadvantage of yielding a mixture of primary, secondary and tertiary amines and also a quaternary ammonium salt. However, primary amine is obtained as a major product by taking large excess of ammonia. The order of reactivity of halides with amines is RI > Rbr > Rcl. Write chemical equations for the following reactions: Example 99999. 11111(i) Reaction of ethanolic NH with C H Cl. 3 2 5(ii) Ammonolysis of benzyl chloride and reaction of amine so formed with two moles of CH Cl. 3 Solution 3. Reduction of nitriles Nitriles on reduction with lithium aluminium hydride(Lialh) or 4 catalytic hydrogenation produce primary amines. This reaction is used for ascent of amine series, i. e., for preparation of amines containing one carbon atom more than the starting amine. 4. Reduction of amides The amides on reduction with lithium aluminium hydride yield amines. 263 Amines Reprint 2025 - 26 5. Gabriel phthalimide synthesis Gabriel synthesis is used for the preparation of primary amines. Phthalimide on treatment with ethanolic potassium hydroxide forms potassium salt of phthalimide which on heating with alkyl halide followed by alkaline hydrolysis produces the corresponding primary amine. Aromatic primary amines cannot be prepared by this method because aryl halides do not undergo nucleophilic substitution with the anion formed by phthalimide. 6. Hoffmann bromamide degradation reaction Hoffmann developed a method for preparation of primary amines by treating an amide with bromine in an aqueous or ethanolic solution of sodium hydroxide. In this degradation reaction, migration of an alkyl or aryl group takes place from carbonyl carbon of the amide to the nitrogen atom. The amine so formed contains one carbon less than that present in the amide. Example 99999. 22222 Write chemical equations for the following conversions:(i) CH CH Cl into CH CH CH NH 3 2 3 2 2 2(ii) C H CH Cl into C H CH CH NH 6 5 2 6 5 2 2 2 Solution Chemistry 264 Reprint 2025 - 26 Write structures and IUPAC names of Example 99999. 33333(i) the amide which gives propanamine by Hoffmann bromamide reaction.(ii) the amine produced by the Hoffmann degradation of benzamide. Solution(i) Propanamine contains three carbons. Hence, the amide molecule must contain four carbon atoms. Structure and IUPAC name of the starting amide with four carbon atoms are given below: Butanamide(ii) Benzamide is an aromatic amide containing seven carbon atoms. Hence, the amine formed from benzamide is aromatic primary amine containing six carbon atoms. Aniline or benzenamine Intext Question 9. 3 How will you convert(i) Benzene into aniline(ii) Benzene into N, N - dimethylaniline(i) Cl(CH) Cl into hexan - 1, 6 - diamine? 2 4 99999. 55555 Physical The lower aliphatic amines are gases with fishy odour. Primary amines with three or more carbon atoms are liquid and still higher ones are Properties solid. Aniline and other arylamines are usually colourless but get coloured on storage due to atmospheric oxidation. Lower aliphatic amines are soluble in water because they can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. However, solubility decreases with increase in molar mass of amines due to increase in size of the hydrophobic alkyl part. Higher amines are essentially insoluble in water. Considering the electronegativity of nitrogen of amine and oxygen of alcohol as 3. 0 and 3. 5 respectively, you can predict the pattern of solubility of amines and alcohols in water. Out of butan - 1 - ol and butan - 1 - amine, which will be more soluble in water and why? Amines are soluble in organic solvents like alcohol, ether and benzene. You may remember that alcohols are more polar than amines and form stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonds than amines. Primary and secondary amines are engaged in intermolecular association due to hydrogen bonding between nitrogen of one and hydrogen of another molecule. This intermolecular association is more in primary amines than in secondary amines as there are two hydrogen atoms available for hydrogen bond formation in it. Tertiary amines do not have intermolecular association due to the absence of hydrogen atom available for hydrogen bond formation. Therefore, the order of boiling points of isomeric amines is as follows: 265 Amines Reprint 2025 - 26 Primary > Secondary > Tertiary Intermolecular hydrogen bonding in primary amines is shown in Fig. 9. 2. Fig. 9. 2 Intermolecular hydrogen bonding in primary amines Boiling points of amines, alcohols and alkanes of almost the same molar mass are shown in Table 9. 2.

The number of hydrogen atoms attached to nitrogen atom also decides the course of reaction of amines; that is why primary(NH), secondary N H and tertiary amines N differ in many 2 reactions. Moreover, amines behave as nucleophiles due to the presence of unshared electron pair. Some of the reactions of amines are described below: 1. Basic character of amines Amines, being basic in nature, react with acids to form salts. Chemistry 266 Reprint 2025 - 26 Amine salts on treatment with a base like NaOH, regenerate the parent amine. Amine salts are soluble in water but insoluble in organic solvents like ether. This reaction is the basis for the separation of amines from the non basic organic compounds insoluble in water. The reaction of amines with mineral acids to form ammonium salts shows that these are basic in nature. Amines have an unshared pair of electrons on nitrogen atom due to which they behave as Lewis base. Basic character of amines can be better understood in terms of their K b and Pk values as explained below: b R NH OH 3 K = R NH H O 2 2 R NH OH or K[H O] = 3 2 R NH 2 R NH OH or K = 3 b R NH 2 Pk = log K b b Larger the value of K or smaller the value of Pk, stronger is the b b base. The Pk values of few amines are given in Table 9. 3. B Pk value of ammonia is 4. 75. Aliphatic amines are stronger bases b than ammonia due to + I effect of alkyl groups leading to high electron density on the nitrogen atom. Their Pk values lie in the range of 3 to b 4. 22. On the other hand, aromatic amines are weaker bases than ammonia due to the electron withdrawing nature of the aryl group. Table 9. 3: Pk Values of Amines in Aqueous Phase b Name of amine Pk b Methanamine 3. 38 N - Methylmethanamine 3. 27 N, N - Dimethylmethanamine 4. 22 Ethanamine 3. 29 N - Ethylethanamine 3. 00 N, N - Diethylethanamine 3. 25 Benzenamine 9. 38 Phenylmethanamine 4. 70 N - Methylaniline 9. 30 N, N - Dimethylaniline 8. 92 267 Amines Reprint 2025 - 26 You may find some discrepancies while trying to interpret the K b values of amines on the basis of + I or I effect of the substituents present in amines. Besides inductive effect, there are other effects like solvation effect, steric hinderance, etc., which affect the basic strength of amines. Just ponder over. You may get the answer in the following paragraphs. Structure - basicity relationship of amines Basicity of amines is related to their structure. Basic character of an amine depends upon the ease of formation of the cation by accepting a proton from the acid. The more stable the cation is relative to the amine, more basic is the amine.(a) Alkanamines versus ammonia Let us consider the reaction of an alkanamine and ammonia with a proton to compare their basicity. Due to the electron releasing nature of alkyl group, it pushes electrons towards nitrogen and thus makes the unshared electron pair more available for sharing with the proton of the acid. Moreover, the substituted ammonium ion formed from the amine gets stabilised due to dispersal of the positive charge by the + I effect of the alkyl group. Hence, alkylamines are stronger bases than ammonia. Thus, the basic nature of aliphatic amines should increase with increase in the number of alkyl groups. This trend is followed in the gaseous phase. The order of basicity of amines in the gaseous phase follows the expected order: tertiary amine > secondary amine > primary amine > NH. The trend is not regular in the aqueous state as evident by th 3 eir Pk values given in Table 9. 3. In the b aqueous phase, the substituted ammonium cations get stabilised not only by electron releasing effect of the alkyl group(+ I) but also by solvation with water molecules. The greater the size of the ion, lesser will be the solvation and the less stabilised is the ion. The order of stability of ions are as follows: Decreasing order of extent of H - bonding in water and order of stability of ions by solvation. Chemistry 268 Reprint 2025 - 26 Greater is the stability of the substituted ammonium cation, stronger should be the corresponding amine as a base. Thus, the order of basicity of aliphatic amines should be: primary > secondary > tertiary, which is opposite to the inductive effect based order. Secondly, when the alkyl group is small, like CH group, there is no steric hindrance to 3 H - bonding. In case the alkyl group is bigger than CH group, there will 3 be steric hinderance to H - bonding. Therefore, the change of nature of the alkyl group, e. g., from CH to C H results in change of the order 3 2 5 of basic strength. Thus, there is a subtle interplay of the inductive effect, solvation effect and steric hinderance of the alkyl group which decides the basic strength of alkyl amines in the aqueous state. The order of basic strength in case of methyl substituted amines and ethyl substituted amines in aqueous solution is as follows:(C H) NH >(C H) N > C H NH > NH 2 5 2 2 5 3 2 5 2 3(CH) NH > CH NH >(CH) N > NH 3 2 3 2 3 3 3(b) Arylamines versus ammonia Pk value of aniline is quite high. Why is it so? It is because in b aniline or other arylamines, the - NH group is attached directly to 2 the benzene ring. It results in the unshared electron pair on nitrogen atom to be in conjugation with the benzene ring and thus making it less available for protonation. If you write different resonating structures of aniline, you will find that aniline is a resonance hybrid of the following five structures. On the other hand, anilinium ion obtained by accepting a proton can have only two resonating structures(kekule). We know that greater the number of resonating structures, greater is the stability. Thus you can infer that aniline(five resonating structures) is more stable than anilinium ion. Hence, the proton acceptability or the basic nature of aniline or other aromatic amines would be less than that of ammonia. In case of substituted aniline, it is observed that electron releasing groups like OCH, CH increase 3 3 basic strength whereas electron withdrawing groups like NO, SO H, 2 3 COOH, X decrease it. 269 Amines Reprint 2025 - 26 Example 99999. 44444 Arrange the following in decreasing order of their basic strength: C H NH, C H NH,(C H) NH, NH 6 5 2 2 5 2 2 52 3 Solution The decreasing order of basic strength of the above amines and ammonia follows the following order:(C H) NH > C H NH > NH > C H NH 2 52 2 5 2 3 6 5 2 2. Alkylation Amines undergo alkylation on reaction with alkyl halides(refer Unit 6, Class XII). 3. Acylation Aliphatic and aromatic primary and secondary amines react with acid chlorides, anhydrides and esters by nucleophilic substitution reaction. This reaction is known as acylation. You can consider this reaction as the replacement of hydrogen atom of NH or > N H 2 group by the acyl group. The products obtained by acylation reaction are known as amides. The reaction is carried out in the presence of a base stronger than the amine, like pyridine, which removes Hcl so formed and shifts the equilibrium to the right hand side. Amines also react with benzoyl chloride(C H COCl). This reaction 6 5 is known as benzoylation. CH NH C H COCl CH NHCOC H Hcl 3 2 6 5 3 6 5 Methanamine Benzoyl chloride N Methylbenzamide What do you think is the product of the reaction of amines with carboxylic acids? They form salts with amines at room temperature. Chemistry 270 Reprint 2025 - 26 4. Carbylamine reaction Aliphatic and aromatic primary amines on heating with chloroform and ethanolic potassium hydroxide form isocyanides or carbylamines which are foul smelling substances. Secondary and tertiary amines do not show this reaction. This reaction is known as carbylamine reaction or isocyanide test and is used as a test for primary amines. 5. Reaction with nitrous acid Three classes of amines react differently with nitrous acid which is prepared in situ from a mineral acid and sodium nitrite.(a) Primary aliphatic amines react with nitrous acid to form aliphatic diazonium salts which being unstable, liberate nitrogen gas quantitatively and alcohols. Quantitative evolution of nitrogen is used in estimation of amino acids and proteins.(b) Aromatic amines react with nitrous acid at low temperatures(273 - 278 K) to form diazonium salts, a very important class of compounds used for synthesis of a variety of aromatic compounds discussed in Section 9. 7. Secondary and tertiary amines react with nitrous acid in a different manner. 6. Reaction with arylsulphonyl chloride Benzenesulphonyl chloride(C H SO Cl), which is also known as 6 5 2 Hinsberg s reagent, reacts with primary and secondary amines to form sulphonamides.(a) The reaction of benzenesulphonyl chloride with primary amine yields N - ethylbenzenesulphonyl amide. The hydrogen attached to nitrogen in sulphonamide is strongly acidic due to the presence of strong electron withdrawing sulphonyl group. Hence, it is soluble in alkali.(b) In the reaction with secondary amine, N, N - diethyl - benzenesulphonamide is formed. O O S Cl + H N C H S N C H + Hcl 2 5 2 5 O C H O C H 2 5 2 5 N, N - Diethylbenzenesulphonamide 271 Amines Reprint 2025 - 26 Since N, N - diethylbenzene sulphonamide does not contain any hydrogen atom attached to nitrogen atom, it is not acidic and hence insoluble in alkali.(c) Tertiary amines do not react with benzenesulphonyl chloride. This property of amines reacting with benzenesulphonyl chloride in a different manner is used for the distinction of primary, secondary and tertiary amines and also for the separation of a mixture of amines. However, these days benzenesulphonyl chloride is replaced by p - toluenesulphonyl chloride. 7. Electrophilic substitution You have read earlier that aniline is a resonance hybrid of five structures. Where do you find the maximum electron density in these structures? Ortho - and para - positions to the NH group 2 become centres of high electron density. Thus NH group is ortho 2 and para directing and a powerful activating group.(a) Bromination: Aniline reacts with bromine water at room temperature to give a white precipitate of 2, 4, 6 - tribromoaniline. The main problem encountered during electrophilic substitution reactions of aromatic amines is that of their very high reactivity. Substitution tends to occur at ortho - and para - positions. If we have to prepare monosubstituted aniline derivative, how can the activating effect of NH group be controlled? This can be 2 done by protecting the - NH group by acetylation with acetic 2 anhydride, then carrying out the desired substitution followed by hydrolysis of the substituted amide to the substituted amine. The lone pair of electrons on nitrogen of acetanilide interacts with oxygen atom due to resonance as shown below: Chemistry 272 Reprint 2025 - 26 Hence, the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen is less available for donation to benzene ring by resonance. Therefore, activating effect of NHCOCH group is less than that of amino group. 3(b) Nitration: Direct nitration of aniline yields tarry oxidation products in addition to the nitro derivatives. Moreover, in the strongly acidic medium, aniline is protonated to form the anilinium ion which is meta directing. That is why besides the ortho and para derivatives, significant amount of meta derivative is also formed. However, by protecting the NH group by acetylation reaction 2 with acetic anhydride, the nitration reaction can be controlled and the p - nitro derivative can be obtained as the major product.(c) Sulphonation: Aniline reacts with concentrated sulphuric acid to form anilinium hydrogensulphate which on heating with sulphuric acid at 453 - 473K produces p - aminobenzene sulphonic acid, commonly known as sulphanilic acid, as the major product. Aniline does not undergo Friedel - Crafts reaction(alkylation and acetylation) due to salt formation with aluminium chloride, the Lewis acid, which is used as a catalyst. Due to this, nitrogen of aniline acquires positive charge and hence acts as a strong deactivating group for further reaction. 273 Amines Reprint 2025 - 26 Intext Questions 9. 4 Arrange the following in increasing order of their basic strength:(i) C H NH, C H NH, NH, C H CH NH and(C H) NH 2 5 2 6 5 2 3 6 5 2 2 2 5 2(ii) C H NH,(C H) NH,(C H) N, C H NH 2 5 2 2 5 2 2 5 3 6 5 2(i) CH NH,(CH) NH,(CH) N, C H NH, C H CH NH. 3 2 32 33 6 5 2 6 5 2 2 9. 5 Complete the following acid - base reactions and name the products:(i) CH CH CH NH + Hcl fi(ii)(C H) N + Hcl fi 3 2 2 2 2 5 3 9. 6 Write reactions of the final alkylation product of aniline with excess of methyl iodide in the presence of sodium carbonate solution. 9. 7 Write chemical reaction of aniline with benzoyl chloride and write the name of the product obtained. 9. 8 Write structures of different isomers corresponding to the molecular formula, C H N. Write IUPAC names of the isomers which will liberate nitrogen gas on 3 9 treatment with nitrous acid. II. DIAZONIUM SALTS The diazonium salts have the general formula RN X where R stands 2 for an aryl group and X ion may be Cl Br, HSO, BF, etc. They are 4 4 named by suffixing diazonium to the name of the parent hydrocarbon from which they are formed, followed by the name of anion such as chloride, hydrogensulphate, etc. The N group is called diazonium 2 group. For example, C H N Cl is named as benzenediazonium 6 5 2 chloride and C H N + HSO is known as benzenediazonium 6 5 2 4 hydrogensulphate. Primary aliphatic amines form highly unstable alkyldiazonium salts(refer to Section 9. 6). Primary aromatic amines form arenediazonium salts which are stable for a short time in solution at low temperatures(273 - 278 K). The stability of arenediazonium ion is explained on the basis of resonance. 99999. 77777 Method of Benzenediazonium chloride is prepared by the reaction of aniline with nitrous acid at 273 - 278K. Nitrous acid is produced in the reaction Preparation mixture by the reaction of sodium nitrite with hydrochloric acid. The of Diazoniun conversion of primary aromatic amines into diazonium salts is known Salts as diazotisation. Due to its instability, the diazonium salt is not generally stored and is used immediately after its preparation.

It is readily soluble in water and is stable in cold but reacts with water when Properties warmed. It decomposes easily in the dry state. Benzenediazonium fluoroborate is water insoluble and stable at room temperature. 99999. 99999 Chemical The reactions of diazonium salts can be broadly divided into two categories, namely(A) reactions involving displacement of nitrogen and Reactions(B) reactions involving retention of diazo group. A. Reactions involving displacement of nitrogen Diazonium group being a very good leaving group, is substituted by other groups such as Cl, Br I CN and OH which displace,, nitrogen from the aromatic ring. The nitrogen formed escapes from the reaction mixture as a gas. 1. Replacement by halide or cyanide ion: The Cl, Br and CN nucleophiles can easily be introduced in the benzene ring in the presence of Cu(I) ion. This reaction is called Sandmeyer reaction. 2 2 2 2 Alternatively, chlorine or bromine can also be introduced in the benzene ring by treating the diazonium salt solution with corresponding halogen acid in the presence of copper powder. This is referred as Gatterman reaction. The yield in Sandmeyer reaction is found to be better than Gattermann reaction. 2. Replacement by iodide ion: Iodine is not easily introduced into the benzene ring directly, but, when the diazonium salt solution is treated with potassium iodide, iodobenzene is formed. 3. Replacement by fluoride ion: When arenediazonium chloride is treated with fluoroboric acid, arene diazonium fluoroborate is precipitated which on heating decomposes to yield aryl fluoride. 4. Replacement by H: Certain mild reducing agents like hypophosphorous acid(phosphinic acid) or ethanol reduce diazonium salts to arenes and themselves get oxidised to phosphorous acid and ethanal, respectively. 275 Amines Reprint 2025 - 26 5. Replacement by hydroxyl group: If the temperature of the diazonium salt solution is allowed to rise upto 283 K, the salt gets hydrolysed to phenol. 6. Replacement by NO group: When diazonium fluoroborate is 2 heated with aqueous sodium nitrite solution in the presence of copper, the diazonium group is replaced by NO group. 2 B. Reactions involving retention of diazo group coupling reactions The azo products obtained have an extended conjugate system having both the aromatic rings joined through the N = N bond. These compounds are often coloured and are used as dyes. Benzene diazonium chloride reacts with phenol in which the phenol molecule at its para position is coupled with the diazonium salt to formp - hydroxyazobenzene. This type of reaction is known as coupling reaction. Similarly the reaction of diazonium salt with aniline yields p - aminoazobenzene. This is an example of electrophilic substitution reaction. 99999. 1111100000 Importance From the above reactions, it is clear that the diazonium salts are very good intermediates for the introduction of F, Cl, Br, I, CN, OH, of Diazonium NO groups into the aromatic ring. Salts in 2 Aryl fluorides and iodides cannot be prepared by direct halogenation. Synthesis The cyano group cannot be introduced by nucleophilic substitution of of Aromatic chlorine in chlorobenzene but cyanobenzene can be easily obtained from diazonium salt. Compounds Thus, the replacement of diazo group by other groups is helpful in Chemistry 276 Reprint 2025 - 26 preparing those substituted aromatic compounds which cannot be prepared by direct substitution in benzene or substituted benzene. How will you convert 4 - nitrotoluene to 2 - bromobenzoic acid?

Sumary Amines can be considered as derivatives of ammonia obtained by replacement of hydrogen atoms with alkyl or aryl groups. Replacement of one hydrogen atom of ammonia gives rise to structure of the type R - NH, known as primary amine. 2 Secondary amines are characterised by the structure R NH or R - NHR ¢ ¢ ¢ ¢ ¢ and tertiary 2 amines by R N, RNR ¢ ¢ ¢ ¢ ¢ R ¢ ¢ ¢ ¢ ¢ ¢ ¢ ¢ ¢ ¢ or R NR ¢ ¢ ¢ ¢ ¢. Secondary and tertiary amines are known as 3 2 simple amines if the alkyl or aryl groups are the same and mixed amines if the groups are different. Like ammonia, all the three types of amines have one unshared electron pair on nitrogen atom due to which they behave as Lewis bases. Amines are usually formed from nitro compounds, halides, amides, imides, etc. They exhibit hydrogen bonding which influence their physical properties. In alkylamines, a combination of electron releasing, steric and H - bonding factors influence the stability of the substituted ammonium cations in protic polar solvents and thus affect the basic nature of amines. Alkyl amines are found to be stronger bases than ammonia. In aromatic amines, electron releasing and withdrawing groups, respectively increase and decrease their basic character. Aniline is a weaker base 277 Amines Reprint 2025 - 26 than ammonia. Reactions of amines are governed by availability of the unshared pair of electrons on nitrogen. Influence of the number of hydrogen atoms at nitrogen atom on the type of reactions and nature of products is responsible for identification and distinction between primary, secondary and tertiary amines. P - Toluenesulphonyl chloride is used for the identification of primary, secondary and tertiary amines. Presence of amino group in aromatic ring enhances reactivity of the aromatic amines. Reactivity of aromatic amines can be controlled by acylation process, i. e., by treating with acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride. Tertiary amines like trimethylamine are used as insect attractants. Aryldiazonium salts, usually obtained from arylamines, undergo replacement of the diazonium group with a variety of nucleophiles to provide advantageous methods for producing aryl halides, cyanides, phenols and arenes by reductive removal of the diazo group. Coupling reaction of aryldiazonium salts with phenols or arylamines give rise to the formation of azo dyes.

These biomolecules interact with each other\nand constitute the molecular logic of life processes. In\naddition, some simple molecules like vitamins and\nmineral salts also play an important role in the functions\nof organisms. Structures and functions of some of these\nbiomolecules are discussed in this Unit.\n1111100000.....11111CCCCCaaaaarrrrrbbbbbooooohhhhhyyyyydddddrrrrraaaaattttteeeeesssss Carbohydrates are primarily produced by plants and form a very large\ngroup of naturally occurring organic compounds. Some common\nexamples of carbohydrates are cane sugar, glucose, starch, etc. Most of\nthem have a general formula, C (H O) , and were considered as hydrates\nx 2 y\nof carbon from where the name carbohydrate was derived. For example,\nthe molecular formula of glucose (C H O ) fits into this general formula,\n6 12 6\nC (H O) . But all the compounds which fit into this formula may not be\n6 2 6\nclassified as carbohydrates. For example acetic acid (CH COOH) fits into\n3\nthis general formula, C (H O) but is not a carbohydrate. Similarly,\n2 2 2\nrhamnose, C H O is a carbohydrate but does not fit in this definition.\n6 12 5\nA large number of their reactions have shown that they contain specific\nfunctional groups. Chemically, the carbohydrates may be defined as\noptically active polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones or the compounds\nwhich produce such units on hydrolysis. Some of the carbohydrates,\nwhich are sweet in taste, are also called sugars. The most common\nsugar, used in our homes is named as sucrose whereas the sugar present\nReprint 2025-26\nin milk is known as lactose. Carbohydrates are also called saccharides\n(Greek: sakcharon means sugar).\nCarbohydrates are classified on the basis of their behaviour on\nhydrolysis. They have been broadly divided into following three groups.\n10.1.1 (i) Monosaccharides: A carbohydrate that cannot be hydrolysed further\nClassification of to give simpler unit of polyhydroxy aldehyde or ketone is called a\nCarbohydrates monosaccharide. About 20 monosaccharides are known to occur in\nnature. Some common examples are glucose, fructose, ribose, etc.\n(ii) Oligosaccharides: Carbohydrates that yield two to ten\nmonosaccharide units, on hydrolysis, are called oligosaccharides. They\nare further classified as disaccharides, trisaccharides, tetrasaccharides,\netc., depending upon the number of monosaccharides, they provide\non hydrolysis. Amongst these the most common are disaccharides.\nThe two monosaccharide units obtained on hydrolysis of a disaccharide\nmay be same or different. For example, one molecule of sucrose on\nhydrolysis gives one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose\nwhereas maltose gives two molecules of only glucose.\n(iii) Polysaccharides: Carbohydrates which yield a large number of\nmonosaccharide units on hydrolysis are called polysaccharides.\nSome common examples are starch, cellulose, glycogen, gums,\netc. Polysaccharides are not sweet in taste, hence they are also\ncalled non-sugars.\nThe carbohydrates may also be classified as either reducing or non-\nreducing sugars. All those carbohydrates which reduce Fehling’s\nsolution and Tollens’ reagent are referred to as reducing sugars. All\nmonosaccharides whether aldose or ketose are reducing sugars.\n10.1.2 Monosaccharides are further classified on the basis of number of carbon\nMonosaccharides atoms and the functional group present in them. If a monosaccharide\ncontains an aldehyde group, it is known as an aldose and if it contains\na keto group, it is known as a ketose. Number of carbon atoms\nconstituting the monosaccharide is also introduced in the name as is\nevident from the examples given in Table 10.1\nTable 10.1: Different Types of Monosaccharides\nCarbon atoms General term Aldehyde Ketone\n3 Triose Aldotriose Ketotriose\n4 Tetrose Aldotetrose Ketotetrose\n5 Pentose Aldopentose Ketopentose\n6 Hexose Aldohexose Ketohexose\n7 Heptose Aldoheptose Ketoheptose\n10.1.2.1 Glucose Glucose occurs freely in nature as well as in the combined form. It is\npresent in sweet fruits and honey. Ripe grapes also contain glucose\nin large amounts. It is prepared as follows:\nPreparation of 1. From sucrose (Cane sugar): If sucrose is boiled with dilute HCl or\nGlucose H SO in alcoholic solution, glucose and fructose are obtained in\n2 4\nequal amounts.\nChemistry 282\nReprint 2025-26\nC H O +H Ofi (cid:190)(cid:190)(cid:190) H+ C H O + C H O\n12 22 11 2 6 12 6 6 12 6\nSucrose Glucose Fructose\n2.

It is the\nStructure of\nmonomer of many of the larger carbohydrates, namely starch, cellulose.\nGlucose\nIt is probably the most abundant organic compound on earth. It was\nassigned the structure given below on the basis of the following\nevidences:\nCHO 1. Its molecular formula was found to be C H O .\n6 12 6\n2. On prolonged heating with HI, it forms n-hexane, suggesting that all\n(CHOH)\n4\nthe six carbon atoms are linked in a straight chain.\nCH OH\n2\nGlucose\n3. Glucose reacts with hydroxylamine to form an oxime and adds a\nmolecule of hydrogen cyanide to give cyanohydrin. These reactions\nconfirm the presence of a carbonyl group (>C = O) in glucose.\n4. Glucose gets oxidised to six carbon carboxylic acid (gluconic acid)\non reaction with a mild oxidising agent like bromine water. This\nindicates that the carbonyl group is present as an aldehydic group.\nCHO COOH\n(CHOH) Br 2 water (CHOH)\n4 4\nCH OH CH OH\n2 2\nGluconic acid\n5. Acetylation of glucose with acetic anhydride gives glucose\npentaacetate which confirms the presence of five –OH groups. Since\nit exists as a stable compound, five –OH groups should be attached\nto different carbon atoms.\n283 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\n6. On oxidation with nitric acid, glucose as well as gluconic acid both\nyield a dicarboxylic acid, saccharic acid.

It should be remembered that\n‘D’ and ‘L’ have no relation with the optical activity of the compound.\nThey are also not related to letter ‘d’ and ‘l’ (see Unit 6). The meaning\nof D– and L– notations is as follows.\nThe letters ‘D’ or ‘L’ before the name of any compound indicate the\nrelative configuration of a particular stereoisomer of a compound with\nrespect to configuration of some other compound, configuration of\nwhich is known. In the case of carbohydrates, this refers to their\nrelation with a particular isomer of glyceraldehyde. Glyceraldehyde\ncontains one asymmetric carbon atom and exists in two enantiomeric\nforms as shown below.\n(+) Isomer of glyceraldehyde has ‘D’ configuration. It means that when\nits structural formula is written on paper following specific conventions\nwhich you will study in higher classes, the –OH group lies on right hand\nside in the structure. All those compounds which can be chemically\ncorrelated to D (+) isomer of glyceraldehyde are said to have D-\nconfiguration whereas those which can be correlated to ‘L’ (–) isomer of\nglyceraldehyde are said to have L—configuration. In L (–) isomer –OH\ngroup is on left hand side as you can see in the structure. For assigning\nReprint 2025-26\nthe configuration of monosaccharides, it is the lowest asymmetric carbon\natom (as shown below) which is compared. As in (+) glucose, —OH on\nthe lowest asymmetric carbon is on the right side which is comparable\nto (+) glyceraldehyde, so (+) glucose is assigned D-configuration. Other\nasymmetric carbon atoms of glucose are not considered for this\ncomparison. Also, the structure of glucose and glyceraldehyde is written\nin a way that most oxidised carbon (in this case –CHO)is at the top.\nCHO\nH OH\n285 Biomolecules\nH O H\nCHO\nH OH\nH OH H OH\nCH 2 OH CH 2 OH\nD– (+) – Glyceraldehyde D–(+) – Glucose\nCyclic The structure (I) of glucose explained most of its properties but the\nStructure following reactions and facts could not be explained by this structure.\nof Glucose 1. Despite having the aldehyde group, glucose does not give Schiff’s\ntest and it does not form the hydrogensulphite addition product with\nNaHSO .\n3\n2. The pentaacetate of glucose does not react with hydroxylamine\nindicating the absence of free —CHO group.\n3. Glucose is found to exist in two different crystalline forms which are\nnamed as a and b. The a-form of glucose (m.p. 419 K) is obtained by\ncrystallisation from concentrated solution of glucose at 303 K while\nthe b-form (m.p. 423 K) is obtained by crystallisation from hot and\nsaturated aqueous solution at 371 K.\nThis behaviour could not be explained by the open chain structure\n(I) for glucose. It was proposed that one of the —OH groups may add\nto the —CHO group and form a cyclic hemiacetal structure. It was\nfound that glucose forms a six-membered ring in which —OH at C-5\nis involved in ring formation. This explains the absence of —CHO\ngroup and also existence of glucose in two forms as shown below.\nThese two cyclic forms exist in equilibrium with open chain structure.\nThe two cyclic hemiacetal forms of glucose differ only in the\nconfiguration of the hydroxyl group at C1, called anomeric carbon\nReprint 2025-26\n(the aldehyde carbon before cyclisation). Such isomers, i.e., a-form\nand b-form, are called anomers. The six membered cyclic structure\nof glucose is called pyranose structure (a– or b–), in analogy with\npyran. Pyran is a cyclic organic compound with one oxygen atom\nand five carbon atoms in the ring. The cyclic structure of glucose is\nmore correctly represented by Haworth structure as given below.\n10.1.2.2 Fructose Fructose is an important ketohexose. It is obtained along with glucose\nby the hydrolysis of disaccharide, sucrose. It is a natural\nmonosaccharide found in fruits, honey and vegetables. In its pure\nform it is used as a sweetner. It is also an important ketohexose.\nFructose also has the molecular formula C H O and\n6 12 6\nStructure on the basis of its reactions it was found to contain a\nof Fructose ketonic functional group at carbon number 2 and six\ncarbons in straight chain as in the case of glucose. It\nbelongs to D-series and is a laevorotatory compound.\nIt is appropriately written as D-(–)-fructose. Its open\nchain structure is as shown.\nIt also exists in two cyclic forms which are obtained\nby the addition of —OH at C5 to the ( ) group. The ring, thus formed\nis a five membered ring and is named as furanose with analogy to the\ncompound furan. Furan is a five membered cyclic compound with one\noxygen and four carbon atoms.\nThe cyclic structures of two anomers of fructose are represented by\nHaworth structures as given.\nChemistry 286\nReprint 2025-26\n10.1.3 You have already read that disaccharides on hydrolysis with dilute\nDisaccharides acids or enzymes yield two molecules of either the same or different\nmonosaccharides. The two monosaccharides are joined together by an\noxide linkage formed by the loss of a water molecule. Such a linkage\nbetween two monosaccharide units through oxygen atom is called\nglycosidic linkage.\nIn disaccharides, if the reducing groups of monosaccharides i.e.,\naldehydic or ketonic groups are bonded, these are non-reducing sugars,\ne.g., sucrose. On the other hand, sugars in which these functional groups\nare free, are called reducing sugars, for example, maltose and lactose.\n(i) Sucrose: One of the common disaccharides is sucrose which on\nhydrolysis gives equimolar mixture of D-(+)-glucose and D-(-) fructose.\nThese two monosaccharides are held together by a glycosidic\nlinkage between C1 of a-D-glucose and C2 of b-D-fructose. Since\nthe reducing groups of glucose and fructose are involved in\nglycosidic bond formation, sucrose is a non reducing sugar.\nSucrose is dextrorotatory but after hydrolysis gives\ndextrorotatory glucose and laevorotatory fructose. Since the\nlaevorotation of fructose (–92.4°) is more than dextrorotation of\nglucose (+ 52.5°), the mixture is laevorotatory. Thus, hydrolysis of\nsucrose brings about a change in the sign of rotation, from dextro\n(+) to laevo (–) and the product is named as invert sugar.\n(ii) Maltose: Another disaccharide, maltose is composed of two\na-D-glucose units in which C1 of one glucose (I) is linked to C4\nof another glucose unit (II). The free aldehyde group can be\nproduced at C1 of second glucose in solution and it shows reducing\nproperties so it is a reducing sugar.\n287 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\n(iii) Lactose: It is more commonly known as milk sugar since this\ndisaccharide is found in milk. It is composed of b-D-galactose and\nb-D-glucose. The linkage is between C1 of galactose and C4 of\nglucose. Free aldehyde group may be produced at C-1 of glucose\nunit, hence it is also a reducing sugar.\n10.1.4\nPolysaccharides Polysaccharides contain a large number of monosaccharide units joined\ntogether by glycosidic linkages. These are the most commonly\nencountered carbohydrates in nature. They mainly act as the food\nstorage or structural materials.\n(i) Starch: Starch is the main storage polysaccharide of plants. It is\nthe most important dietary source for human beings. High content\nof starch is found in cereals, roots, tubers and some vegetables. It\nis a polymer of a-glucose and consists of two components—\nAmylose and Amylopectin. Amylose is water soluble component\nwhich constitutes about 15-20% of starch. Chemically amylose is\na long unbranched chain with 200-1000 a-D-(+)-glucose units\nheld together by C1– C4 glycosidic linkage.\nAmylopectin is insoluble in water and constitutes about 80-\n85% of starch. It is a branched chain polymer of a-D-glucose\nunits in which chain is formed by C1–C4 glycosidic linkage whereas\nbranching occurs by C1–C6 glycosidic linkage.\nChemistry 288\nReprint 2025-26\n(ii) Cellulose: Cellulose occurs exclusively in plants and it is the most\nabundant organic substance in plant kingdom. It is a predominant\nconstituent of cell wall of plant cells. Cellulose is a straight chain\npolysaccharide composed only of b-D-glucose units which are\njoined by glycosidic linkage between C1 of one glucose unit and\nC4 of the next glucose unit.\n(iii) Glycogen: The carbohydrates are stored in animal body as glycogen.\nIt is also known as animal starch because its structure is similar to\namylopectin and is rather more highly branched. It is present in liver,\nmuscles and brain. When the body needs glucose, enzymes break the\nglycogen down to glucose. Glycogen is also found in yeast and fungi.\n10.1.5 Carbohydrates are essential for life in both plants and animals. They\nImportance of form a major portion of our food. Honey has been used for a long time\nCarbohydrates as an instant source of energy by ‘Vaids’ in ayurvedic system of\nmedicine. Carbohydrates are used as storage molecules as starch in\nplants and glycogen in animals. Cell wall of bacteria and plants is\nmade up of cellulose. We build furniture, etc. from cellulose in the form\n289 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\nof wood and clothe ourselves with cellulose in the form of cotton fibre.\nThey provide raw materials for many important industries like textiles,\npaper, lacquers and breweries.\nTwo aldopentoses viz. D-ribose and 2-deoxy-D-ribose (Section\n10.5.1, Class XII) are present in nucleic acids. Carbohydrates are found\nin biosystem in combination with many proteins and lipids.\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n10.1 Glucose or sucrose are soluble in water but cyclohexane or\nbenzene (simple six membered ring compounds) are insoluble in\nwater.

They are also required for\ngrowth and maintenance of body. The word protein is derived from\nGreek word, “proteios” which means primary or of prime importance.\nAll proteins are polymers of a-amino acids.\n10.2.1 Amino Amino acids contain amino (–NH 2 ) and carboxyl (–COOH) functional\ngroups. Depending upon the relative position of amino group with\nAcids\nrespect to carboxyl group, the amino acids can be\nR CH COOH\nclassified as a, b, g, d and so on. Only a-amino\nacids are obtained on hydrolysis of proteins. They NH\n2\nmay contain other functional groups also. a-amino acid\nAll a-amino acids have trivial names, which (R = side chain)\nusually reflect the property of that compound or\nits source. Glycine is so named since it has sweet taste (in Greek glykos\nmeans sweet) and tyrosine was first obtained from cheese (in Greek, tyros\nmeans cheese.) Amino acids are generally represented by a three letter\nsymbol, sometimes one letter symbol is also used. Structures of some\ncommonly occurring amino acids along with their 3-letter and 1-letter\nsymbols are given in Table 10.2.\nCOOH\nTable 10.2: Natural Amino Acids H N H\n2\nR\nName of the Characteristic feature Three letter One letter\namino acids of side chain, R symbol code\n1.

The\namino acids, which can be synthesised in the body, are known as non-\nessential amino acids. On the other hand, those which cannot be\nsynthesised in the body and must be obtained through diet, are known\nas essential amino acids (marked with asterisk in Table10.2).\n291 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\nAmino acids are usually colourless, crystalline solids. These are\nwater-soluble, high melting solids and behave like salts rather than\nsimple amines or carboxylic acids. This behaviour is due to the presence\nof both acidic (carboxyl group) and basic (amino\ngroup) groups in the same molecule. In aqueous\nsolution, the carboxyl group can lose a proton\nand amino group can accept a proton, giving rise\nto a dipolar ion known as zwitter ion. This is\nneutral but contains both positive and negative\ncharges.\nIn zwitter ionic form, amino acids show amphoteric behaviour as\nthey react both with acids and bases.\nExcept glycine, all other naturally occurring a-amino acids are\noptically active, since the a-carbon atom is asymmetric. These exist\nboth in ‘D’ and ‘L’ forms. Most naturally occurring amino acids have\nL-configuration. L-Aminoacids are represented by writing the –NH group\n2\non left hand side.\n10.2.3 Structure You have already read that proteins are the polymers of a-amino acids\nof Proteins and they are connected to each other by peptide bond or peptide\nlinkage. Chemically, peptide linkage is an amide formed between\n–COOH group and –NH group. The reaction between two molecules of\n2\nsimilar or different amino acids, proceeds through\nthe combination of the amino group of one molecule\nwith the carboxyl group of the other. This results in\nthe elimination of a water molecule and formation of\na peptide bond –CO–NH–. The product of the reaction\nis called a dipeptide because it is made up of two\namino acids. For example, when carboxyl group of\nglycine combines with the amino group of alanine\nwe get a dipeptide, glycylalanine.\nIf a third amino acid combines to a dipeptide, the product is called a\ntripeptide. A tripeptide contains three amino acids linked by two peptide\nlinkages. Similarly when four, five or six amino acids are linked, the respective\nproducts are known as tetrapeptide, pentapeptide or hexapeptide,\nrespectively. When the number of such amino acids is more than ten, then\nthe products are called polypeptides. A polypeptide with more than hundred\namino acid residues, having molecular mass higher than 10,000u is called\na protein. However, the distinction between a polypeptide and a protein is\nnot very sharp. Polypeptides with fewer amino acids are likely to be called\nproteins if they ordinarily have a well defined conformation of a protein such\nas insulin which contains 51 amino acids.\nProteins can be classified into two types on the basis of their\nmolecular shape.\n(a) Fibrous proteins\nWhen the polypeptide chains run parallel and are held together by\nhydrogen and disulphide bonds, then fibre– like structure is formed. Such\nproteins are generally insoluble in water. Some common examples are\nkeratin (present in hair, wool, silk) and myosin (present in muscles), etc.\nChemistry 292\nReprint 2025-26\n(b) Globular proteins\nThis structure results when the chains of polypeptides coil around\nto give a spherical shape. These are usually soluble in water. Insulin\nand albumins are the common examples of globular proteins.\nStructure and shape of proteins can be studied at four different\nlevels, i.e., primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary, each level\nbeing more complex than the previous one.\n(i) Primary structure of proteins: Proteins may have\none or more polypeptide chains. Each polypeptide in a\nprotein has amino acids linked with each other in a\nspecific sequence and it is this sequence of amino acids\nthat is said to be the primary structure of that protein.\nAny change in this primary structure i.e., the sequence\nof amino acids creates a different protein.\n(ii) Secondary structure of proteins: The secondary\nstructure of protein refers to the shape in which a long\npolypeptide chain can exist. They are found to exist in\ntwo different types of structures viz. a-helix and\nb-pleated sheet structure. These structures arise due\nto the regular folding of the backbone of the polypeptide\nchain due to hydrogen bonding between and\n–NH– groups of the peptide bond.\na-Helix is one of the most common ways in which\na polypeptide chain forms all possible hydrogen bonds\nby twisting into a right handed screw (helix) with the\n–NH group of each amino acid residue hydrogen bonded to the\nFig. 10.1: a-Helix\nstructure of proteins C O of an adjacent turn of the helix as shown in Fig.10.1.\nIn b-pleated sheet structure all peptide chains are\nstretched out to nearly maximum extension and then\nlaid side by side which are held together by\nintermolecular hydrogen bonds. The structure resembles\nthe pleated folds of drapery and therefore is known as\nb-pleated sheet.\n(iii)Tertiary structure of proteins: The tertiary\nstructure of proteins represents overall folding of the\npolypeptide chains i.e., further folding of the secondary\nstructure. It gives rise to two major molecular shapes\nviz. fibrous and globular. The main forces which\nstabilise the 2° and 3° structures of proteins are\nhydrogen bonds, disulphide linkages, van der Waals\nand electrostatic forces of attraction.\nFig. 10.2: b-Pleated sheet structure of (iv) Quaternary structure of proteins: Some of the\nproteins proteins are composed of two or more polypeptide\nchains referred to as sub-units. The spatial\narrangement of these subunits with respect to each\nother is known as quaternary structure.\n293 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\nA diagrammatic representation of all these four structures is\ngiven in Figure 10.3 where each coloured ball represents an\namino acid.\nFig. 10.3: Diagrammatic representation of protein structure (two sub-units\nof two types in quaternary structure)\nFig. 10.4: Primary,\nsecondary, tertiary\nand quaternary\nstructures of\nhaemoglobin\n10.2.4 Protein found in a biological system with a unique three-dimensional\nDenaturation of structure and biological activity is called a native protein. When a\nProteins protein in its native form, is subjected to physical change like change\nin temperature or chemical change like change in pH, the hydrogen\nbonds are disturbed. Due to this, globules unfold and helix get uncoiled\nand protein loses its biological activity. This is called denaturation of\nChemistry 294\nReprint 2025-26\nprotein. During denaturation secondary and tertiary structures are\ndestroyed but primary structure remains intact. The coagulation of\negg white on boiling is a common example of denaturation. Another\nexample is curdling of milk which is caused due to the formation of\nlactic acid by the bacteria present in milk.\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n10.4 The melting points and solubility in water of amino acids are generally\nhigher than that of the corresponding halo acids.

An example is the digestion of food, absorption of\nappropriate molecules and ultimately production of energy. This process\ninvolves a sequence of reactions and all these reactions occur in the\nbody under very mild conditions. This occurs with the help of certain\nbiocatalysts called enzymes. Almost all the enzymes are globular\nproteins. Enzymes are very specific for a particular reaction and for a\nparticular substrate. They are generally named after the compound or\nclass of compounds upon which they work. For example, the enzyme\nthat catalyses hydrolysis of maltose into glucose is named as maltase.\nMaltase\nC H O  2C H O\n12 22 11 6 12 6\nMaltose Glucose\nSometimes enzymes are also named after the reaction, where they\nare used. For example, the enzymes which catalyse the oxidation of\none substrate with simultaneous reduction of another substrate are\nnamed as oxidoreductase enzymes. The ending of the name of an\nenzyme is -ase.\n10.3.1 Mechanism\nEnzymes are needed only in small quantities for the progress of a reaction.\nof Enzyme\nSimilar to the action of chemical catalysts, enzymes are said to reduce\nAction\nthe magnitude of activation energy. For example, activation energy for\nacid hydrolysis of sucrose is 6.22 kJ mol–1, while the activation energy is\nonly 2.15 kJ mol–1 when hydrolysed by the enzyme, sucrase. Mechanism\nfor the enzyme action has been discussed.\n1111100000.....44444 VVVVViiiiitttttaaaaammmmmiiiiinnnnnsssss\nIt has been observed that certain organic compounds are required in\nsmall amounts in our diet but their deficiency causes specific diseases.\nThese compounds are called vitamins. Most of the vitamins cannot be\nsynthesised in our body but plants can synthesise almost all of them,\nso they are considered as essential food factors. However, the bacteria\nof the gut can produce some of the vitamins required by us. All the\nvitamins are generally available in our diet. Different vitamins belong\nto various chemical classes and it is difficult to define them on the\nbasis of structure. They are generally regarded as organic compounds\nrequired in the diet in small amounts to perform specific\nbiological functions for normal maintenance of optimum growth\n295 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\nand health of the organism. Vitamins are designated by alphabets\nA, B, C, D, etc. Some of them are further named as sub-groups e.g. B ,\n1\nB , B , B , etc. Excess of vitamins is also harmful and vitamin pills\n2 6 12\nshould not be taken without the advice of doctor.\nThe term “Vitamine” was coined from the word vital + amine since\nthe earlier identified compounds had amino groups. Later work showed\nthat most of them did not contain amino groups, so the letter ‘e’ was\ndropped and the term vitamin is used these days.\n10.4.1 Vitamins are classified into two groups depending upon their solubility\nClassification of in water or fat.\nVitamins (i) Fat soluble vitamins: Vitamins which are soluble in fat and oils\nbut insoluble in water are kept in this group. These are vitamins A,\nD, E and K. They are stored in liver and adipose (fat storing) tissues.\n(ii) Water soluble vitamins: B group vitamins and vitamin C are soluble\nin water so they are grouped together. Water soluble vitamins must\nbe supplied regularly in diet because they are readily excreted in\nurine and cannot be stored (except vitamin B ) in our body.\n12\nSome important vitamins, their sources and diseases caused by\ntheir deficiency are listed in Table 10.3.\nTable 10.3: Some important Vitamins, their Sources and their\nDeficiency Diseases\nSl.

How are these characteristics transmitted from one\ngeneration to the next? It has been observed that nucleus of a living\ncell is responsible for this transmission of inherent characters, also\ncalled heredity. The particles in nucleus of the cell, responsible for\nheredity, are called chromosomes which are made up of proteins and\nanother type of biomolecules called nucleic acids. These are mainly\nof two types, the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid\n(RNA). Since nucleic acids are long chain polymers of nucleotides, so\nthey are also called polynucleotides.\nJames Dewey Watson\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois, in 1928, Dr Watson received his Ph.D.\n(1950) from Indiana University in Zoology. He is best known for\nhis discovery of the structure of DNA for which he shared with\nFrancis Crick and Maurice Wilkins the 1962 Nobel prize in\nPhysiology and Medicine. They proposed that DNA molecule takes\nthe shape of a double helix, an elegantly simple structure that\nresembles a gently twisted ladder. The rails of the ladder are\nmade of alternating units of phosphate and the sugar deoxyribose;\nthe rungs are each composed of a pair of purine/ pyrimidine bases. This\nresearch laid the foundation for the emerging field of molecular biology. The\ncomplementary pairing of nucleotide bases explains how identical copies of\nparental DNA pass on to two daughter cells. This research launched a revolution\nin biology that led to modern recombinant DNA techniques.\n10.5.1 Chemical Complete hydrolysis of DNA (or RNA) yields a pentose sugar, phosphoric\nComposition acid and nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds (called bases). In\nof Nucleic DNA molecules, the sugar moiety is b-D-2-deoxyribose whereas in\nAcids RNA molecule, it is b-D-ribose.\n297 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\nDNA contains four bases viz. adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C)\nand thymine (T). RNA also contains four bases, the first three bases are\nsame as in DNA but the fourth one is uracil (U).\nCytosine (C) Thymine (T) Uracil (U)\n10.5.2 Structure A unit formed by the attachment of a base to 1¢ position of sugar is\nof Nucleic known as nucleoside. In nucleosides, the sugar carbons are numbered\nAcids as 1¢, 2¢, 3¢, etc. in order to distinguish these from the bases\n(Fig. 10.5a). When nucleoside is linked to phosphoric acid at 5¢-position\nof sugar moiety, we get a nucleotide (Fig. 10.5).\nFig. 10.5: Structure of (a) a nucleoside and (b) a nucleotide\nNucleotides are joined together by phosphodiester linkage between\n5¢ and 3¢ carbon atoms of the pentose sugar.

Nucleic acids\nhave a secondary structure also. James Watson and Francis Crick\ngave a double strand helix structure for DNA (Fig. 10.7). Two\nnucleic acid chains are wound about each other and held together\nby hydrogen bonds between pairs of bases. The two strands are\ncomplementary to each other because the hydrogen bonds are\nformed between specific pairs of bases. Adenine forms hydrogen\nbonds with thymine whereas cytosine forms hydrogen bonds\nwith guanine.\nIn secondary structure of RNA single stranded helics is present\nwhich sometimes foldsback on itself. RNA molecules are of three\ntypes and they perform different functions. They are named as\nmessenger RNA (m-RNA), ribosomal RNA (r-RNA) and transfer\nRNA (t-RNA).\nFig. 10.7: Double strand helix structure for DNA\n299 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\nHar Gobind Khorana\nHar Gobind Khorana, was born in 1922. He obtained his M.Sc.\ndegree from Punjab University in Lahore. He worked with Professor\nVladimir Prelog, who moulded Khorana’s thought and philosophy\ntowards science, work and effort. After a brief stay in India in\n1949, Khorana went back to England and worked with Professor\nG.W. Kenner and Professor A.R.Todd. It was at Cambridge, U.K.\nthat he got interested in both proteins and nucleic acids. Dr Khorana shared the\nNobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology in 1968 with Marshall Nirenberg and Robert\nHolley for cracking the genetic code.\nDNA Fingerprinting\nIt is known that every individual has unique fingerprints. These occur at the tips of\nthe fingers and have been used for identification for a long time but these can be\naltered by surgery. A sequence of bases on DNA is also unique for a person and\ninformation regarding this is called DNA fingerprinting. It is same for every cell and\ncannot be altered by any known treatment. DNA fingerprinting is now used\n(i) in forensic laboratories for identification of criminals.\n(ii) to determine paternity of an individual.\n(iii) to identify the dead bodies in any accident by comparing the DNA’s of parents or\nchildren.\n(iv) to identify racial groups to rewrite biological evolution.\n10.5.3 Biological DNA is the chemical basis of heredity and may be regarded as the reserve\nFunctions of genetic information. DNA is exclusively responsible for maintaining\nof Nucleic the identity of different species of organisms over millions of years. A\nAcids DNA molecule is capable of self duplication during cell division and\nidentical DNA strands are transferred to daughter cells. Another important\nfunction of nucleic acids is the protein synthesis in the cell. Actually, the\nproteins are synthesised by various RNA molecules in the cell but the\nmessage for the synthesis of a particular protein is present in DNA.\n1111100000.....66666 HHHHHooooorrrrrmmmmmooooonnnnneeeeesssss Hormones are molecules that act as intercellular messengers. These\nare produced by endocrine glands in the body and are poured directly\nin the blood stream which transports them to the site of action.\nIn terms of chemical nature, some of these are steroids, e.g., estrogens\nand androgens; some are poly peptides for example insulin and\nendorphins and some others are amino acid derivatives such as\nepinephrine and norepinephrine.\nHormones have several functions in the body. They help to maintain\nthe balance of biological activities in the body. The role of insulin in keeping\nthe blood glucose level within the narrow limit is an example of this\nfunction. Insulin is released in response to the rapid rise in blood glucose\nlevel. On the other hand hormone glucagon tends to increase the glucose\nlevel in the blood. The two hormones together regulate the glucose level\nin the blood. Epinephrine and norepinephrine mediate responses to\nexternal stimuli. Growth hormones and sex hormones play role in growth\nand development. Thyroxine produced in the thyroid gland is an iodinated\nderivative of amino acid tyrosine. Abnormally low level of thyroxine leads\nChemistry 300\nReprint 2025-26\nto hypothyroidism which is characterised by lethargyness and obesity.\nIncreased level of thyroxine causes hyperthyroidism. Low level of iodine\nin the diet may lead to hypothyroidism and enlargement of the thyroid\ngland. This condition is largely being controlled by adding sodium iodide\nto commercial table salt (“Iodised” salt).\nSteroid hormones are produced by adrenal cortex and gonads (testes\nin males and ovaries in females). Hormones released by the adrenal cortex\nplay very important role in the functions of the body. For example,\nglucocorticoids control the carbohydrate metabolism, modulate\ninflammatory reactions, and are involved in reactions to stress. The\nmineralocorticoids control the level of excretion of water and salt by the\nkidney. If adrenal cortex does not function properly then one of the results\nmay be Addison’s disease characterised by hypoglycemia, weakness and\nincreased susceptibility to stress. The disease is fatal unless it is treated by\nglucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. Hormones released by gonads are\nresponsible for development of secondary sex characters. Testosterone is\nthe major sex hormone produced in males. It is responsible for development\nof secondary male characteristics (deep voice, facial hair, general physical\nconstitution) and estradiol is the main female sex hormone. It is responsible\nfor development of secondary female characteristics and participates in\nthe control of menstrual cycle. Progesterone is responsible for preparing\nthe uterus for implantation of fertilised egg.\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n10.6 Why cannot vitamin C be stored in our body?\n10.7 What products would be formed when a nucleotide from DNA containing\nthymine is hydrolysed?\n10.8 When RNA is hydrolysed, there is no relationship among the quantities of different\nbases obtained.

They are broadly classified into three groups —\nmonosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides. Glucose, the most important\nsource of energy for mammals, is obtained by the digestion of starch. Monosaccharides\nare held together by glycosidic linkages to form disaccharides or polysaccharides.\nProteins are the polymers of about twenty different aaaaa-amino acids which are\nlinked by peptide bonds. Ten amino acids are called essential amino acids because\nthey cannot be synthesised by our body, hence must be provided through diet. Proteins\nperform various structural and dynamic functions in the organisms. Proteins which\ncontain only a-amino acids are called simple proteins. The secondary or tertiary\nstructure of proteins get disturbed on change of pH or temperature and they are not\nable to perform their functions. This is called denaturation of proteins. Enzymes are\nbiocatalysts which speed up the reactions in biosystems. They are very specific and\nselective in their action and chemically majority of enzymes are proteins.\nVitamins are accessory food factors required in the diet. They are classified as\nfat soluble (A, D, E and K) and water soluble (B group and C). Deficiency of vitamins\nleads to many diseases.\n301 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\nNucleic acids are the polymers of nucleotides which in turn consist of a base,\na pentose sugar and phosphate moiety.

These biomolecules interact with each other and constitute the molecular logic of life processes. In addition, some simple molecules like vitamins and mineral salts also play an important role in the functions of organisms. Structures and functions of some of these biomolecules are discussed in this Unit. 1111100000. 11111Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are primarily produced by plants and form a very large group of naturally occurring organic compounds. Some common examples of carbohydrates are cane sugar, glucose, starch, etc. Most of them have a general formula, C(H O), and were considered as hydrates x 2 y of carbon from where the name carbohydrate was derived. For example, the molecular formula of glucose(C H O) fits into this general formula, 6 12 6 C(H O). But all the compounds which fit into this formula may not be 6 2 6 classified as carbohydrates. For example acetic acid(CH COOH) fits into 3 this general formula, C(H O) but is not a carbohydrate. Similarly, 2 2 2 rhamnose, C H O is a carbohydrate but does not fit in this definition. 6 12 5 A large number of their reactions have shown that they contain specific functional groups. Chemically, the carbohydrates may be defined as optically active polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones or the compounds which produce such units on hydrolysis. Some of the carbohydrates, which are sweet in taste, are also called sugars. The most common sugar, used in our homes is named as sucrose whereas the sugar present Reprint 2025 - 26 in milk is known as lactose. Carbohydrates are also called saccharides(Greek: sakcharon means sugar). Carbohydrates are classified on the basis of their behaviour on hydrolysis. They have been broadly divided into following three groups. 10. 1. 1(i) Monosaccharides: A carbohydrate that cannot be hydrolysed further Classification of to give simpler unit of polyhydroxy aldehyde or ketone is called a Carbohydrates monosaccharide. About 20 monosaccharides are known to occur in nature. Some common examples are glucose, fructose, ribose, etc.(ii) Oligosaccharides: Carbohydrates that yield two to ten monosaccharide units, on hydrolysis, are called oligosaccharides. They are further classified as disaccharides, trisaccharides, tetrasaccharides, etc., depending upon the number of monosaccharides, they provide on hydrolysis. Amongst these the most common are disaccharides. The two monosaccharide units obtained on hydrolysis of a disaccharide may be same or different. For example, one molecule of sucrose on hydrolysis gives one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose whereas maltose gives two molecules of only glucose.(i) Polysaccharides: Carbohydrates which yield a large number of monosaccharide units on hydrolysis are called polysaccharides. Some common examples are starch, cellulose, glycogen, gums, etc. Polysaccharides are not sweet in taste, hence they are also called non - sugars. The carbohydrates may also be classified as either reducing or non - reducing sugars. All those carbohydrates which reduce Fehling s solution and Tollens reagent are referred to as reducing sugars. All monosaccharides whether aldose or ketose are reducing sugars. 10. 1. 2 Monosaccharides are further classified on the basis of number of carbon Monosaccharides atoms and the functional group present in them. If a monosaccharide contains an aldehyde group, it is known as an aldose and if it contains a keto group, it is known as a ketose. Number of carbon atoms constituting the monosaccharide is also introduced in the name as is evident from the examples given in Table 10. 1 Table 10. 1: Different Types of Monosaccharides Carbon atoms General term Aldehyde Ketone 3 Triose Aldotriose Ketotriose 4 Tetrose Aldotetrose Ketotetrose 5 Pentose Aldopentose Ketopentose 6 Hexose Aldohexose Ketohexose 7 Heptose Aldoheptose Ketoheptose 10. 1. 2. 1 Glucose Glucose occurs freely in nature as well as in the combined form.

On prolonged heating with HI, it forms n - hexane, suggesting that all(CHOH) 4 the six carbon atoms are linked in a straight chain. CH OH 2 Glucose 3. Glucose reacts with hydroxylamine to form an oxime and adds a molecule of hydrogen cyanide to give cyanohydrin. These reactions confirm the presence of a carbonyl group(> C = O) in glucose. 4. Glucose gets oxidised to six carbon carboxylic acid(gluconic acid) on reaction with a mild oxidising agent like bromine water. This indicates that the carbonyl group is present as an aldehydic group. CHO COOH(CHOH) Br 2 water(CHOH) 4 4 CH OH CH OH 2 2 Gluconic acid 5. Acetylation of glucose with acetic anhydride gives glucose pentaacetate which confirms the presence of five OH groups. Since it exists as a stable compound, five OH groups should be attached to different carbon atoms. 283 Biomolecules Reprint 2025 - 26 6. On oxidation with nitric acid, glucose as well as gluconic acid both yield a dicarboxylic acid, saccharic acid. This indicates the presence of a primary alcoholic(OH) group in glucose.

CHO H OH Chemistry 284 H O COOH H OH H H OH H OH CH OH 2 I H O COOH H OH H H OH H OH CH OH 2 II H O H H OH H OH COOH I Glucose is correctly named as D(+) - glucose. D before the name of glucose represents the configuration whereas(+) represents dextrorotatory nature of the molecule. It should be remembered that D and L have no relation with the optical activity of the compound. They are also not related to letter d and l(see Unit 6). The meaning of D and L notations is as follows. The letters D or L before the name of any compound indicate the relative configuration of a particular stereoisomer of a compound with respect to configuration of some other compound, configuration of which is known. In the case of carbohydrates, this refers to their relation with a particular isomer of glyceraldehyde. Glyceraldehyde contains one asymmetric carbon atom and exists in two enantiomeric forms as shown below.(+) Isomer of glyceraldehyde has D configuration. It means that when its structural formula is written on paper following specific conventions which you will study in higher classes, the OH group lies on right hand side in the structure. All those compounds which can be chemically correlated to D(+) isomer of glyceraldehyde are said to have D - configuration whereas those which can be correlated to L() isomer of glyceraldehyde are said to have L configuration. In L() isomer OH group is on left hand side as you can see in the structure. For assigning Reprint 2025 - 26 the configuration of monosaccharides, it is the lowest asymmetric carbon atom(as shown below) which is compared. As in(+) glucose, OH on the lowest asymmetric carbon is on the right side which is comparable to(+) glyceraldehyde, so(+) glucose is assigned D - configuration. Other asymmetric carbon atoms of glucose are not considered for this comparison. Also, the structure of glucose and glyceraldehyde is written in a way that most oxidised carbon(in this case CHO) is at the top. CHO H OH 285 Biomolecules H O H CHO H OH H OH H OH CH 2 OH CH 2 OH D(+) Glyceraldehyde D(+) Glucose Cyclic The structure(I) of glucose explained most of its properties but the Structure following reactions and facts could not be explained by this structure. Of Glucose 1. Despite having the aldehyde group, glucose does not give Schiff s test and it does not form the hydrogensulphite addition product with NaHSO. 3 2. The pentaacetate of glucose does not react with hydroxylamine indicating the absence of free CHO group. 3. Glucose is found to exist in two different crystalline forms which are named as a and b. The a - form of glucose(m. p. 419 K) is obtained by crystallisation from concentrated solution of glucose at 303 K while the b - form(m. p. 423 K) is obtained by crystallisation from hot and saturated aqueous solution at 371 K. This behaviour could not be explained by the open chain structure(I) for glucose. It was proposed that one of the OH groups may add to the CHO group and form a cyclic hemiacetal structure. It was found that glucose forms a six - membered ring in which OH at C - 5 is involved in ring formation. This explains the absence of CHO group and also existence of glucose in two forms as shown below. These two cyclic forms exist in equilibrium with open chain structure. The two cyclic hemiacetal forms of glucose differ only in the configuration of the hydroxyl group at C1, called anomeric carbon Reprint 2025 - 26(the aldehyde carbon before cyclisation). Such isomers, i. e., a - form and b - form, are called anomers. The six membered cyclic structure of glucose is called pyranose structure(a or b), in analogy with pyran. Pyran is a cyclic organic compound with one oxygen atom and five carbon atoms in the ring. The cyclic structure of glucose is more correctly represented by Haworth structure as given below. 10. 1. 2. 2 Fructose Fructose is an important ketohexose. It is obtained along with glucose by the hydrolysis of disaccharide, sucrose. It is a natural monosaccharide found in fruits, honey and vegetables. In its pure form it is used as a sweetner. It is also an important ketohexose. Fructose also has the molecular formula C H O and 6 12 6 Structure on the basis of its reactions it was found to contain a of Fructose ketonic functional group at carbon number 2 and six carbons in straight chain as in the case of glucose. It belongs to D - series and is a laevorotatory compound. It is appropriately written as D -() - fructose. Its open chain structure is as shown. It also exists in two cyclic forms which are obtained by the addition of OH at C5 to the() group. The ring, thus formed is a five membered ring and is named as furanose with analogy to the compound furan. Furan is a five membered cyclic compound with one oxygen and four carbon atoms. The cyclic structures of two anomers of fructose are represented by Haworth structures as given. Chemistry 286 Reprint 2025 - 26 10. 1. 3 You have already read that disaccharides on hydrolysis with dilute Disaccharides acids or enzymes yield two molecules of either the same or different monosaccharides. The two monosaccharides are joined together by an oxide linkage formed by the loss of a water molecule. Such a linkage between two monosaccharide units through oxygen atom is called glycosidic linkage. In disaccharides, if the reducing groups of monosaccharides i. e., aldehydic or ketonic groups are bonded, these are non - reducing sugars, e. g., sucrose. On the other hand, sugars in which these functional groups are free, are called reducing sugars, for example, maltose and lactose.(i) Sucrose: One of the common disaccharides is sucrose which on hydrolysis gives equimolar mixture of D -(+) - glucose and D -(-) fructose. These two monosaccharides are held together by a glycosidic linkage between C1 of a - D - glucose and C2 of b - D - fructose. Since the reducing groups of glucose and fructose are involved in glycosidic bond formation, sucrose is a non reducing sugar. Sucrose is dextrorotatory but after hydrolysis gives dextrorotatory glucose and laevorotatory fructose. Since the laevorotation of fructose(92. 4 °) is more than dextrorotation of glucose(+ 52. 5 °), the mixture is laevorotatory. Thus, hydrolysis of sucrose brings about a change in the sign of rotation, from dextro(+) to laevo() and the product is named as invert sugar.(ii) Maltose: Another disaccharide, maltose is composed of two a - D - glucose units in which C1 of one glucose(I) is linked to C4 of another glucose unit(II). The free aldehyde group can be produced at C1 of second glucose in solution and it shows reducing properties so it is a reducing sugar. 287 Biomolecules Reprint 2025 - 26(i) Lactose: It is more commonly known as milk sugar since this disaccharide is found in milk. It is composed of b - D - galactose and b - D - glucose. The linkage is between C1 of galactose and C4 of glucose. Free aldehyde group may be produced at C - 1 of glucose unit, hence it is also a reducing sugar. 10. 1. 4 Polysaccharides Polysaccharides contain a large number of monosaccharide units joined together by glycosidic linkages. These are the most commonly encountered carbohydrates in nature. They mainly act as the food storage or structural materials.(i) Starch: Starch is the main storage polysaccharide of plants. It is the most important dietary source for human beings. High content of starch is found in cereals, roots, tubers and some vegetables. It is a polymer of a - glucose and consists of two components Amylose and Amylopectin. Amylose is water soluble component which constitutes about 15 - 20 % of starch. Chemically amylose is a long unbranched chain with 200 - 1000 a - D -(+) - glucose units held together by C1 C4 glycosidic linkage. Amylopectin is insoluble in water and constitutes about 80 - 85 % of starch. It is a branched chain polymer of a - D - glucose units in which chain is formed by C1 C4 glycosidic linkage whereas branching occurs by C1 C6 glycosidic linkage. Chemistry 288 Reprint 2025 - 26(ii) Cellulose: Cellulose occurs exclusively in plants and it is the most abundant organic substance in plant kingdom. It is a predominant constituent of cell wall of plant cells. Cellulose is a straight chain polysaccharide composed only of b - D - glucose units which are joined by glycosidic linkage between C1 of one glucose unit and C4 of the next glucose unit.(i) Glycogen: The carbohydrates are stored in animal body as glycogen. It is also known as animal starch because its structure is similar to amylopectin and is rather more highly branched. It is present in liver, muscles and brain. When the body needs glucose, enzymes break the glycogen down to glucose. Glycogen is also found in yeast and fungi. 10. 1. 5 Carbohydrates are essential for life in both plants and animals. They Importance of form a major portion of our food. Honey has been used for a long time Carbohydrates as an instant source of energy by Vaids in ayurvedic system of medicine. Carbohydrates are used as storage molecules as starch in plants and glycogen in animals. Cell wall of bacteria and plants is made up of cellulose. We build furniture, etc. From cellulose in the form 289 Biomolecules Reprint 2025 - 26 of wood and clothe ourselves with cellulose in the form of cotton fibre. They provide raw materials for many important industries like textiles, paper, lacquers and breweries. Two aldopentoses viz. D - ribose and 2 - deoxy - D - ribose(Section 10. 5. 1, Class XII) are present in nucleic acids. Carbohydrates are found in biosystem in combination with many proteins and lipids.

Explain. 10. 2 What are the expected products of hydrolysis of lactose? 10. 3 How do you explain the absence of aldehyde group in the pentaacetate of D - glucose? 1111100000. 22222 Proteins Proteins are the most abundant biomolecules of the living system. Chief sources of proteins are milk, cheese, pulses, peanuts, fish, meat, etc. They occur in every part of the body and form the fundamental basis of structure and functions of life. They are also required for growth and maintenance of body. The word protein is derived from Greek word, proteios which means primary or of prime importance. All proteins are polymers of a - amino acids. 10. 2. 1 Amino Amino acids contain amino(NH 2) and carboxyl(COOH) functional groups. Depending upon the relative position of amino group with Acids respect to carboxyl group, the amino acids can be R CH COOH classified as a, b, g, d and so on. Only a - amino acids are obtained on hydrolysis of proteins. They NH 2 may contain other functional groups also. A - amino acid All a - amino acids have trivial names, which(R = side chain) usually reflect the property of that compound or its source. Glycine is so named since it has sweet taste(in Greek glykos means sweet) and tyrosine was first obtained from cheese(in Greek, tyros means cheese.) Amino acids are generally represented by a three letter symbol, sometimes one letter symbol is also used. Structures of some commonly occurring amino acids along with their 3 - letter and 1 - letter symbols are given in Table 10. 2.

Proline Pro P * essential amino acid, a = entire structure 10. 2. 2 Amino acids are classified as acidic, basic or neutral depending upon Classification of the relative number of amino and carboxyl groups in their molecule. Amino Acids Equal number of amino and carboxyl groups makes it neutral; more number of amino than carboxyl groups makes it basic and more carboxyl groups as compared to amino groups makes it acidic. The amino acids, which can be synthesised in the body, are known as non - essential amino acids. On the other hand, those which cannot be synthesised in the body and must be obtained through diet, are known as essential amino acids(marked with asterisk in Table10. 2). 291 Biomolecules Reprint 2025 - 26 Amino acids are usually colourless, crystalline solids. These are water - soluble, high melting solids and behave like salts rather than simple amines or carboxylic acids. This behaviour is due to the presence of both acidic(carboxyl group) and basic(amino group) groups in the same molecule. In aqueous solution, the carboxyl group can lose a proton and amino group can accept a proton, giving rise to a dipolar ion known as zwitter ion. This is neutral but contains both positive and negative charges. In zwitter ionic form, amino acids show amphoteric behaviour as they react both with acids and bases. Except glycine, all other naturally occurring a - amino acids are optically active, since the a - carbon atom is asymmetric. These exist both in D and L forms. Most naturally occurring amino acids have L - configuration. L - Aminoacids are represented by writing the NH group 2 on left hand side. 10. 2. 3 Structure You have already read that proteins are the polymers of a - amino acids of Proteins and they are connected to each other by peptide bond or peptide linkage. Chemically, peptide linkage is an amide formed between COOH group and NH group. The reaction between two molecules of 2 similar or different amino acids, proceeds through the combination of the amino group of one molecule with the carboxyl group of the other. This results in the elimination of a water molecule and formation of a peptide bond CO NH. The product of the reaction is called a dipeptide because it is made up of two amino acids. For example, when carboxyl group of glycine combines with the amino group of alanine we get a dipeptide, glycylalanine. If a third amino acid combines to a dipeptide, the product is called a tripeptide. A tripeptide contains three amino acids linked by two peptide linkages. Similarly when four, five or six amino acids are linked, the respective products are known as tetrapeptide, pentapeptide or hexapeptide, respectively. When the number of such amino acids is more than ten, then the products are called polypeptides. A polypeptide with more than hundred amino acid residues, having molecular mass higher than 10, 000u is called a protein. However, the distinction between a polypeptide and a protein is not very sharp. Polypeptides with fewer amino acids are likely to be called proteins if they ordinarily have a well defined conformation of a protein such as insulin which contains 51 amino acids. Proteins can be classified into two types on the basis of their molecular shape.(a) Fibrous proteins When the polypeptide chains run parallel and are held together by hydrogen and disulphide bonds, then fibre like structure is formed. Such proteins are generally insoluble in water. Some common examples are keratin(present in hair, wool, silk) and myosin(present in muscles), etc. Chemistry 292 Reprint 2025 - 26(b) Globular proteins This structure results when the chains of polypeptides coil around to give a spherical shape. These are usually soluble in water. Insulin and albumins are the common examples of globular proteins. Structure and shape of proteins can be studied at four different levels, i. e., primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary, each level being more complex than the previous one.(i) Primary structure of proteins: Proteins may have one or more polypeptide chains. Each polypeptide in a protein has amino acids linked with each other in a specific sequence and it is this sequence of amino acids that is said to be the primary structure of that protein. Any change in this primary structure i. e., the sequence of amino acids creates a different protein.(ii) Secondary structure of proteins: The secondary structure of protein refers to the shape in which a long polypeptide chain can exist. They are found to exist in two different types of structures viz. A - helix and b - pleated sheet structure. These structures arise due to the regular folding of the backbone of the polypeptide chain due to hydrogen bonding between and NH groups of the peptide bond. A - Helix is one of the most common ways in which a polypeptide chain forms all possible hydrogen bonds by twisting into a right handed screw(helix) with the NH group of each amino acid residue hydrogen bonded to the Fig. 10. 1: a - Helix structure of proteins C O of an adjacent turn of the helix as shown in Fig. 10. 1. In b - pleated sheet structure all peptide chains are stretched out to nearly maximum extension and then laid side by side which are held together by intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The structure resembles the pleated folds of drapery and therefore is known as b - pleated sheet.(i) Tertiary structure of proteins: The tertiary structure of proteins represents overall folding of the polypeptide chains i. e., further folding of the secondary structure. It gives rise to two major molecular shapes viz. Fibrous and globular. The main forces which stabilise the 2 ° and 3 ° structures of proteins are hydrogen bonds, disulphide linkages, van der Waals and electrostatic forces of attraction. Fig. 10. 2: b - Pleated sheet structure of(iv) Quaternary structure of proteins: Some of the proteins proteins are composed of two or more polypeptide chains referred to as sub - units. The spatial arrangement of these subunits with respect to each other is known as quaternary structure. 293 Biomolecules Reprint 2025 - 26 A diagrammatic representation of all these four structures is given in Figure 10. 3 where each coloured ball represents an amino acid. Fig. 10. 3: Diagrammatic representation of protein structure(two sub - units of two types in quaternary structure) Fig. 10. 4: Primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures of haemoglobin 10. 2. 4 Protein found in a biological system with a unique three - dimensional Denaturation of structure and biological activity is called a native protein. When a Proteins protein in its native form, is subjected to physical change like change in temperature or chemical change like change in Ph, the hydrogen bonds are disturbed. Due to this, globules unfold and helix get uncoiled and protein loses its biological activity. This is called denaturation of Chemistry 294 Reprint 2025 - 26 protein. During denaturation secondary and tertiary structures are destroyed but primary structure remains intact. The coagulation of egg white on boiling is a common example of denaturation. Another example is curdling of milk which is caused due to the formation of lactic acid by the bacteria present in milk. Intext Questions 10. 4 The melting points and solubility in water of amino acids are generally higher than that of the corresponding halo acids. Explain. 10. 5 Where does the water present in the egg go after boiling the egg? 1111100000. 33333 Enzymes Life is possible due to the coordination of various chemical reactions in living organisms. An example is the digestion of food, absorption of appropriate molecules and ultimately production of energy. This process involves a sequence of reactions and all these reactions occur in the body under very mild conditions. This occurs with the help of certain biocatalysts called enzymes. Almost all the enzymes are globular proteins. Enzymes are very specific for a particular reaction and for a particular substrate. They are generally named after the compound or class of compounds upon which they work. For example, the enzyme that catalyses hydrolysis of maltose into glucose is named as maltase. Maltase C H O 2C H O 12 22 11 6 12 6 Maltose Glucose Sometimes enzymes are also named after the reaction, where they are used. For example, the enzymes which catalyse the oxidation of one substrate with simultaneous reduction of another substrate are named as oxidoreductase enzymes. The ending of the name of an enzyme is - ase. 10. 3. 1 Mechanism Enzymes are needed only in small quantities for the progress of a reaction. Of Enzyme Similar to the action of chemical catalysts, enzymes are said to reduce Action the magnitude of activation energy. For example, activation energy for acid hydrolysis of sucrose is 6. 22 Kj mol 1, while the activation energy is only 2. 15 Kj mol 1 when hydrolysed by the enzyme, sucrase. Mechanism for the enzyme action has been discussed. 1111100000. 44444 Vitamins It has been observed that certain organic compounds are required in small amounts in our diet but their deficiency causes specific diseases. These compounds are called vitamins. Most of the vitamins cannot be synthesised in our body but plants can synthesise almost all of them, so they are considered as essential food factors. However, the bacteria of the gut can produce some of the vitamins required by us. All the vitamins are generally available in our diet. Different vitamins belong to various chemical classes and it is difficult to define them on the basis of structure. They are generally regarded as organic compounds required in the diet in small amounts to perform specific biological functions for normal maintenance of optimum growth 295 Biomolecules Reprint 2025 - 26 and health of the organism. Vitamins are designated by alphabets A, B, C, D, etc. Some of them are further named as sub - groups e. g. B, 1 B, B, B, etc. Excess of vitamins is also harmful and vitamin pills 2 6 12 should not be taken without the advice of doctor. The term Vitamine was coined from the word vital + amine since the earlier identified compounds had amino groups. Later work showed that most of them did not contain amino groups, so the letter e was dropped and the term vitamin is used these days. 10. 4. 1 Vitamins are classified into two groups depending upon their solubility Classification of in water or fat. Vitamins(i) Fat soluble vitamins: Vitamins which are soluble in fat and oils but insoluble in water are kept in this group. These are vitamins A, D, E and K. They are stored in liver and adipose(fat storing) tissues.(ii) Water soluble vitamins: B group vitamins and vitamin C are soluble in water so they are grouped together. Water soluble vitamins must be supplied regularly in diet because they are readily excreted in urine and cannot be stored(except vitamin B) in our body. 12 Some important vitamins, their sources and diseases caused by their deficiency are listed in Table 10. 3. Table 10. 3: Some important Vitamins, their Sources and their Deficiency Diseases Sl. Name of Sources Deficiency diseases No. Vitamins 1.

How are these characteristics transmitted from one generation to the next? It has been observed that nucleus of a living cell is responsible for this transmission of inherent characters, also called heredity. The particles in nucleus of the cell, responsible for heredity, are called chromosomes which are made up of proteins and another type of biomolecules called nucleic acids. These are mainly of two types, the deoxyribonucleic acid(DNA) and ribonucleic acid(RNA). Since nucleic acids are long chain polymers of nucleotides, so they are also called polynucleotides. James Dewey Watson Born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1928, Dr Watson received his Ph. D.(1950) from Indiana University in Zoology. He is best known for his discovery of the structure of DNA for which he shared with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins the 1962 Nobel prize in Physiology and Medicine. They proposed that DNA molecule takes the shape of a double helix, an elegantly simple structure that resembles a gently twisted ladder. The rails of the ladder are made of alternating units of phosphate and the sugar deoxyribose; the rungs are each composed of a pair of purine / pyrimidine bases. This research laid the foundation for the emerging field of molecular biology. The complementary pairing of nucleotide bases explains how identical copies of parental DNA pass on to two daughter cells. This research launched a revolution in biology that led to modern recombinant DNA techniques. 10. 5. 1 Chemical Complete hydrolysis of DNA(or RNA) yields a pentose sugar, phosphoric Composition acid and nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds(called bases). In of Nucleic DNA molecules, the sugar moiety is b - D - 2 - deoxyribose whereas in Acids RNA molecule, it is b - D - ribose. 297 Biomolecules Reprint 2025 - 26 DNA contains four bases viz. Adenine(A), guanine(G), cytosine(C) and thymine(T). RNA also contains four bases, the first three bases are same as in DNA but the fourth one is uracil(U). Cytosine(C) Thymine(T) Uracil(U) 10. 5. 2 Structure A unit formed by the attachment of a base to 1 ¢ position of sugar is of Nucleic known as nucleoside. In nucleosides, the sugar carbons are numbered Acids as 1 ¢, 2 ¢, 3 ¢, etc. In order to distinguish these from the bases(Fig. 10. 5a). When nucleoside is linked to phosphoric acid at 5 ¢ - position of sugar moiety, we get a nucleotide(Fig. 10. 5). Fig. 10. 5: Structure of(a) a nucleoside and(b) a nucleotide Nucleotides are joined together by phosphodiester linkage between 5 ¢ and 3 ¢ carbon atoms of the pentose sugar. The formation of a typical dinucleotide is shown in Fig. 10. 6. Chemistry 298 Reprint 2025 - 26 Fig. 10. 6: Formation of a dinucleotide A simplified version of nucleic acid chain is as shown below. Base Base Base Sugar Phosphate Sugar Phosphate Sugar n Information regarding the sequence of nucleotides in the chain of a nucleic acid is called its primary structure. Nucleic acids have a secondary structure also. James Watson and Francis Crick gave a double strand helix structure for DNA(Fig. 10. 7). Two nucleic acid chains are wound about each other and held together by hydrogen bonds between pairs of bases. The two strands are complementary to each other because the hydrogen bonds are formed between specific pairs of bases. Adenine forms hydrogen bonds with thymine whereas cytosine forms hydrogen bonds with guanine. In secondary structure of RNA single stranded helics is present which sometimes foldsback on itself. RNA molecules are of three types and they perform different functions. They are named as messenger RNA(m - RNA), ribosomal RNA(r - RNA) and transfer RNA(t - RNA). Fig. 10. 7: Double strand helix structure for DNA 299 Biomolecules Reprint 2025 - 26 Har Gobind Khorana Har Gobind Khorana, was born in 1922. He obtained his M. Sc. Degree from Punjab University in Lahore. He worked with Professor Vladimir Prelog, who moulded Khorana s thought and philosophy towards science, work and effort. After a brief stay in India in 1949, Khorana went back to England and worked with Professor G. W. Kenner and Professor A. R. Todd. It was at Cambridge, U. K. That he got interested in both proteins and nucleic acids. Dr Khorana shared the Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology in 1968 with Marshall Nirenberg and Robert Holley for cracking the genetic code. DNA Fingerprinting It is known that every individual has unique fingerprints. These occur at the tips of the fingers and have been used for identification for a long time but these can be altered by surgery. A sequence of bases on DNA is also unique for a person and information regarding this is called DNA fingerprinting. It is same for every cell and cannot be altered by any known treatment. DNA fingerprinting is now used(i) in forensic laboratories for identification of criminals.(ii) to determine paternity of an individual.(i) to identify the dead bodies in any accident by comparing the DNA s of parents or children.(iv) to identify racial groups to rewrite biological evolution. 10. 5. 3 Biological DNA is the chemical basis of heredity and may be regarded as the reserve Functions of genetic information. DNA is exclusively responsible for maintaining of Nucleic the identity of different species of organisms over millions of years. A Acids DNA molecule is capable of self duplication during cell division and identical DNA strands are transferred to daughter cells. Another important function of nucleic acids is the protein synthesis in the cell. Actually, the proteins are synthesised by various RNA molecules in the cell but the message for the synthesis of a particular protein is present in DNA. 1111100000. 66666 Hormones Hormones are molecules that act as intercellular messengers. These are produced by endocrine glands in the body and are poured directly in the blood stream which transports them to the site of action. In terms of chemical nature, some of these are steroids, e. g., estrogens and androgens; some are poly peptides for example insulin and endorphins and some others are amino acid derivatives such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. Hormones have several functions in the body. They help to maintain the balance of biological activities in the body. The role of insulin in keeping the blood glucose level within the narrow limit is an example of this function. Insulin is released in response to the rapid rise in blood glucose level. On the other hand hormone glucagon tends to increase the glucose level in the blood. The two hormones together regulate the glucose level in the blood. Epinephrine and norepinephrine mediate responses to external stimuli. Growth hormones and sex hormones play role in growth and development. Thyroxine produced in the thyroid gland is an iodinated derivative of amino acid tyrosine. Abnormally low level of thyroxine leads Chemistry 300 Reprint 2025 - 26 to hypothyroidism which is characterised by lethargyness and obesity. Increased level of thyroxine causes hyperthyroidism. Low level of iodine in the diet may lead to hypothyroidism and enlargement of the thyroid gland. This condition is largely being controlled by adding sodium iodide to commercial table salt(Iodised salt). Steroid hormones are produced by adrenal cortex and gonads(testes in males and ovaries in females). Hormones released by the adrenal cortex play very important role in the functions of the body. For example, glucocorticoids control the carbohydrate metabolism, modulate inflammatory reactions, and are involved in reactions to stress. The mineralocorticoids control the level of excretion of water and salt by the kidney. If adrenal cortex does not function properly then one of the results may be Addison s disease characterised by hypoglycemia, weakness and increased susceptibility to stress. The disease is fatal unless it is treated by glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. Hormones released by gonads are responsible for development of secondary sex characters. Testosterone is the major sex hormone produced in males. It is responsible for development of secondary male characteristics(deep voice, facial hair, general physical constitution) and estradiol is the main female sex hormone. It is responsible for development of secondary female characteristics and participates in the control of menstrual cycle. Progesterone is responsible for preparing the uterus for implantation of fertilised egg. Intext Questions 10. 6 Why cannot vitamin C be stored in our body? 10. 7 What products would be formed when a nucleotide from DNA containing thymine is hydrolysed? 10. 8 When RNA is hydrolysed, there is no relationship among the quantities of different bases obtained. What does this fact suggest about the structure of RNA? Sumary Carbohydrates are optically active polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones or molecules which provide such units on hydrolysis. They are broadly classified into three groups monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides. Glucose, the most important source of energy for mammals, is obtained by the digestion of starch. Monosaccharides are held together by glycosidic linkages to form disaccharides or polysaccharides. Proteins are the polymers of about twenty different a - amino acids which are linked by peptide bonds. Ten amino acids are called essential amino acids because they cannot be synthesised by our body, hence must be provided through diet. Proteins perform various structural and dynamic functions in the organisms. Proteins which contain only a - amino acids are called simple proteins. The secondary or tertiary structure of proteins get disturbed on change of Ph or temperature and they are not able to perform their functions. This is called denaturation of proteins. Enzymes are biocatalysts which speed up the reactions in biosystems. They are very specific and selective in their action and chemically majority of enzymes are proteins. Vitamins are accessory food factors required in the diet. They are classified as fat soluble(A, D, E and K) and water soluble(B group and C). Deficiency of vitamins leads to many diseases. 301 Biomolecules Reprint 2025 - 26 Nucleic acids are the polymers of nucleotides which in turn consist of a base, a pentose sugar and phosphate moiety. Nucleic acids are responsible for the transfer of characters from parents to offsprings. There are two types of nucleic acids DNA and RNA. DNA contains a five carbon sugar molecule called 2 - deoxyribose whereas RNA contains ribose. Both DNA and RNA contain adenine, guanine and cytosine. The fourth base is thymine in DNA and uracil in RNA. The structure of DNA is a double strand whereas RNA is a single strand molecule. DNA is the chemical basis of heredity and have the coded message for proteins to be synthesised in the cell. There are three types of RNA mRNA, rRNA and tRNA which actually carry out the protein synthesis in the cell.

People in ancient India,\nalready had the knowledge of many scientific phenomenon much before the advent of\nmodern science. They applied the knowledge in various walks of life.\nThe study of chemistry is very important as its domain encompasses every sphere\nof life. Chemists study the properties and structure of substances and the changes\nundergone by them. All substances contain matter, which can exist in three states –\nsolid, liquid or gas. The constituent particles are held in different ways in these states\nof matter and they exhibit their characteristic properties. Matter can also be classified\ninto elements, compounds or mixtures. An element contains particles of only one type,\nwhich may be atoms or molecules. The compounds are formed where atoms of two or\nmore elements combine in a fixed ratio to each other. Mixtures occur widely and many\nof the substances present around us are mixtures.\nWhen the properties of a substance are studied, measurement is inherent. The\nquantification of properties requires a system of measurement and units in which the\nquantities are to be expressed. Many systems of measurement exist, of which the English\nReprint 2025-26\nUnit 1.indd 24 11/30/2022 14:49:36\nSome BaSic conceptS of chemiStry 25\nand the Metric Systems are widely used. The scientific community, however, has agreed to\nhave a uniform and common system throughout the world, which is abbreviated as SI units\n(International System of Units).\nSince measurements involve recording of data, which are always associated with a certain\namount of uncertainty, the proper handling of data obtained by measuring the quantities\nis very important. The measurements of quantities in chemistry are spread over a wide\nrange of 10–31 to 10+23. Hence, a convenient system of expressing the numbers in scientific\nnotation is used. The uncertainty is taken care of by specifying the number of significant\nfigures, in which the observations are reported. The dimensional analysis helps to express\nthe measured quantities in different systems of units. Hence, it is possible to interconvert\nthe results from one system of units to another.\nThe combination of different atoms is governed by basic laws of chemical combination\n— these being the law of conservation of mass, Law of Definite Proportions, Law of\nmultiple proportions, Gay lussac’s law of Gaseous volumes and avogadro law. All\nthese laws led to the Dalton’s atomic theory, which states that atoms are building blocks\nof matter. The atomic mass of an element is expressed relative to 12C isotope of carbon,\nwhich has an exact value of 12u. Usually, the atomic mass used for an element is the\naverage atomic mass obtained by taking into account the natural abundance of different\nisotopes of that element. The molecular mass of a molecule is obtained by taking sum of\nthe atomic masses of different atoms present in a molecule. The molecular formula can be\ncalculated by determining the mass per cent of different elements present in a compound\nand its molecular mass.\nThe number of atoms, molecules or any other particles present in a given system are\nexpressed in the terms of avogadro constant (6.022 × 1023). This is known as 1 mol of the\nrespective particles or entities.\nChemical reactions represent the chemical changes undergone by different elements and\ncompounds. A balanced chemical equation provides a lot of information. The coefficients\nindicate the molar ratios and the respective number of particles taking part in a particular\nreaction. The quantitative study of the reactants required or the products formed is called\nstoichiometry. Using stoichiometric calculations, the amount of one or more reactant(s)\nrequired to produce a particular amount of product can be determined and vice-versa. The\namount of substance present in a given volume of a solution is expressed in number of ways,\ne.g., mass per cent, mole fraction, molarity and molality.\nexerciSeS\n1.1 Calculate the molar mass of the following:\n(i) H O (ii) CO (iii) CH\n2 2 4\n1.2 Calculate the mass per cent of different elements present in sodium sulphate\n(Na SO ).\n2 4\n1.3 Determine the empirical formula of an oxide of iron, which has 69.9% iron and\n30.1% dioxygen by mass.\n1.4 Calculate the amount of carbon dioxide that could be produced when\n(i) 1 mole of carbon is burnt in air.\n(ii) 1 mole of carbon is burnt in 16 g of dioxygen.\n(iii) 2 moles of carbon are burnt in 16 g of dioxygen.\n1.5 Calculate the mass of sodium acetate (CH COONa) required to make 500 mL of\n3\n0.375 molar aqueous solution.

Acharya Kanda, structure, properties and interection of matter born in 600 BCE, originally known by the name Kashyap, was the first proponent and is of much use to human beings in daily of the atomic theory. He formulated the life. These aspects can be best described and theory of very small indivisible particles, understood in terms of basic constituents of which he named Paramãnu(comparable matter that are atoms and molecules. That to atoms). He authored the text Vaiseshika is why, chemistry is also called the science of Sutras. According to him, all substances are atoms and molecules. Can we see, weigh and aggregated form of smaller units called atoms perceive these entities(atoms and molecules)?(Paramãnu), which are eternal, indestructible, Is it possible to count the number of atoms spherical, suprasensible and in motion in and molecules in a given mass of matter and the original state. He explained that this have a quantitative relationship between the individual entity cannot be sensed through mass and the number of these particles? Any human organ. Kanda added that there We will get the answer of some of these are varieties of atoms that are as different as questions in this Unit. We will further describe the different classes of substances.

Has been confirmed by various experiments. It is sometimes also referred to as law of 1. 5. 5 avogadro s law Definite Composition. In 1811, Avogadro proposed that equal volumes of all gases at the same temperature 1. 5. 3 law of multiple proportions and pressure should contain equal number This law was proposed by Dalton in 1803.

Avogadro made a distinction According to this law, if two elements can between atoms and molecules which is combine to form more than one compound, quite understandable in present times. If the masses of one element that combine with we consider again the reaction of hydrogen a fixed mass of the other element, are in the and oxygen to produce water, we see that ratio of small whole numbers.

Balancing a chemical equation According to the law of conservation of mass, a balanced chemical equation has the same number of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation. Many chemical equations can be balanced by trial and error. Let us take the reactions of a few metals and non - metals with oxygen to give oxides 4 Fe(s) + 3O(g) 2Fe O(s)(a) balanced equation 2 2 3 2 Mg(s) + O(g) 2MgO(s)(b) balanced equation 2 P(s) + O(g) P O(s)(c) unbalanced equation 4 2 4 10 Equations(a) and(b) are balanced, since there are same number of metal and oxygen atoms on each side of the equations. However equation(c) is not balanced. In this equation, phosphorus atoms are balanced but not the oxygen atoms. To balance it, we must place the coefficient 5 on the left of oxygen on the left side of the equation to balance the oxygen atoms appearing on the right side of the equation. P(s) + 5O(g) P O(s) balanced equation 4 2 4 10 Now, let us take combustion of propane, C H. This equation can be balanced in steps. 3 8 Step 1 Write down the correct formulas of reactants and products. Here, propane and oxygen are reactants, and carbon dioxide and water are products. C H(g) + O(g) CO(g) + H O(l) unbalanced equation 3 8 2 2 2 Step 2 Balance the number of C atoms: Since 3 carbon atoms are in the reactant, therefore, three CO molecules are required on the right side. 2 C H(g) + O(g) 3CO(g) + H O(l) 3 8 2 2 2 Step 3 Balance the number of H atoms: on the left there are 8 hydrogen atoms in the reactants however, each molecule of water has two hydrogen atoms, so four molecules of water will be required for eight hydrogen atoms on the right side. C H(g) + O(g) 3CO(g) + 4H O(l) 3 8 2 2 2 Step 4 Balance the number of O atoms: There are 10 oxygen atoms on the right side(3 × 2 = 6 in CO and 4 × 1 = 4 in water). Therefore, five O molecules are needed to supply the required 10 CO 2 2 2 and 4 × 1 = 4 in water). Therefore, five O molecules are needed to supply the required 10 oxygen 2 atoms. C H(g) + 5O(g) 3CO(g) + 4H O(l) 3 8 2 2 2 Step 5 Verify that the number of atoms of each element is balanced in the final equation. The equation shows three carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and 10 oxygen atoms on each side. All equations that have correct formulas for all reactants and products can be balanced. Always remember that subscripts in formulas of reactants and products cannot be changed to balance an equation.

Mass per cent Molarity(M) = Volume of solution in litres It is obtained by using the following relation: Suppose, we have 1 M solution of a substance, say NaOH, and we want to prepare a 0. 2 M solution from it. 1 M NaOH means 1 mol of NaOH present in 1 litre of the solution. For 0. 2 M solution, problem 1. 6 we require 0. 2 moles of NaOH dissolved in 1 litre solution. A solution is prepared by adding 2 g of a substance A to 18 g of water. Calculate Hence, for making 0. 2M solution from 1M the mass per cent of the solute. Solution, we have to take that volume of 1M NaOH solution, which contains 0. 2 mol of NaOH Solution and dilute the solution with water to 1 litre. Now, how much volume of concentrated(1M) NaOH solution be taken, which contains 0. 2 moles of NaOH can be calculated as follows: If 1 mol is present in 1L or 1000 Ml solution then, 0. 2 mol is present in 1000mL × 0. 2molsolution 1mol 2.

Mass of solvent in kg Summary Chemistry, as we understand it today is not a very old discipline. People in ancient India, already had the knowledge of many scientific phenomenon much before the advent of modern science. They applied the knowledge in various walks of life. The study of chemistry is very important as its domain encompasses every sphere of life. Chemists study the properties and structure of substances and the changes undergone by them. All substances contain matter, which can exist in three states solid, liquid or gas. The constituent particles are held in different ways in these states of matter and they exhibit their characteristic properties. Matter can also be classified into elements, compounds or mixtures. An element contains particles of only one type, which may be atoms or molecules. The compounds are formed where atoms of two or more elements combine in a fixed ratio to each other. Mixtures occur widely and many of the substances present around us are mixtures. When the properties of a substance are studied, measurement is inherent. The quantification of properties requires a system of measurement and units in which the quantities are to be expressed. Many systems of measurement exist, of which the English Reprint 2025 - 26 Unit 1. indd 24 11 / 30 / 2022 14: 49: 36 Some Basic Concepts of Chemistry 25 and the Metric Systems are widely used. The scientific community, however, has agreed to have a uniform and common system throughout the world, which is abbreviated as SI units(International System of Units). Since measurements involve recording of data, which are always associated with a certain amount of uncertainty, the proper handling of data obtained by measuring the quantities is very important. The measurements of quantities in chemistry are spread over a wide range of 10 31 to 10 + 23. Hence, a convenient system of expressing the numbers in scientific notation is used. The uncertainty is taken care of by specifying the number of significant figures, in which the observations are reported. The dimensional analysis helps to express the measured quantities in different systems of units. Hence, it is possible to interconvert the results from one system of units to another. The combination of different atoms is governed by basic laws of chemical combination these being the law of conservation of mass, Law of Definite Proportions, Law of multiple proportions, Gay lussac s law of Gaseous volumes and avogadro law. All these laws led to the Dalton s atomic theory, which states that atoms are building blocks of matter. The atomic mass of an element is expressed relative to 12C isotope of carbon, which has an exact value of 12u. Usually, the atomic mass used for an element is the average atomic mass obtained by taking into account the natural abundance of different isotopes of that element. The molecular mass of a molecule is obtained by taking sum of the atomic masses of different atoms present in a molecule. The molecular formula can be calculated by determining the mass per cent of different elements present in a compound and its molecular mass. The number of atoms, molecules or any other particles present in a given system are expressed in the terms of avogadro constant(6. 022 × 1023). This is known as 1 mol of the respective particles or entities. Chemical reactions represent the chemical changes undergone by different elements and compounds. A balanced chemical equation provides a lot of information. The coefficients indicate the molar ratios and the respective number of particles taking part in a particular reaction. The quantitative study of the reactants required or the products formed is called stoichiometry. Using stoichiometric calculations, the amount of one or more reactant(s) required to produce a particular amount of product can be determined and vice - versa. The amount of substance present in a given volume of a solution is expressed in number of ways, e. g., mass per cent, mole fraction, molarity and molality.

An orbit, as proposed by Bohr, is a circular path around the\nnucleus in which an electron moves. A precise description of this path of the electron is impossible\naccording to Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr orbits, therefore, have no real meaning and\ntheir existence can never be demonstrated experimentally. An atomic orbital, on the other hand,\nis a quantum mechanical concept and refers to the one electron wave function ψ in an atom. It is\ncharacterized by three quantum numbers (n, l and m) and its value depends upon the coordinates\nl\nof the electron. ψ has, by itself, no physical meaning. It is the square of the wave function i.e., |ψ|2\nwhich has a physical meaning. |ψ|2 at any point in an atom gives the value of probability density\nat that point. Probability density (|ψ|2) is the probability per unit volume and the product of |ψ|2\nand a small volume (called a volume element) yields the probability of finding the electron in that\nvolume (the reason for specifying a small volume element is that |ψ|2 varies from one region to\nanother in space but its value can be assumed to be constant within a small volume element).\nThe total probability of finding the electron in a given volume can then be calculated by the sum\nof all the products of |ψ|2 and the corresponding volume elements. It is thus possible to get the\nprobable distribution of an electron in an orbital.\nReprint 2025-26\nUnit 2.indd 56 9/9/2022 4:28:17 PM\nstructure of atom 57\nthe number of orbitals is equal to the\nnumber of ways in which they are\noriented.\niv) m refers to orientation of the spin of the\ns\nelectron.\nProblem 2.17\nWhat is the total number of orbitals\nassociated with the principal quantum\nnumber n = 3 ?\nsolution\nFor n = 3, the possible values of l are\n0, 1 and 2.

Starting from The number of electrons to be filled in various\norbitals is restricted by the exclusion principle,\ngiven by the Austrian scientist Wolfgang Pauli\n(1926). According to this principle : No two\nelectrons in an atom can have the same set\nof four quantum numbers. Pauli exclusion\nprinciple can also be stated as : “Only two\nelectrons may exist in the same orbital and\nthese electrons must have opposite spin.”\nThis means that the two electrons can have\nthe same value of three quantum numbers\nn, l and m, but must have the opposite spin\nl\nquantum number. The restriction imposed\nby Pauli’s exclusion principle on the number\nof electrons in an orbital helps in calculating\nthe capacity of electrons to be present in any\nsubshell. For example, subshell 1s comprises\none orbital and thus the maximum number of\nelectrons present in 1s subshell can be two, in\np and d subshells, the maximum number of\nelectrons can be 6 and 10 and so on.

The completely filled\nor half filled subshells have symmetrical\ndistribution of electrons in them and\nare therefore more stable. Electrons in\nthe same subshell (here 3d) have equal\nenergy but different spatial distribution.\nConsequently, their shielding of one-\nanother is relatively small and the\nelectrons are more strongly attracted by\nthe nucleus.\n2. Exchange Energy : The stabilizing\neffect arises whenever two or more\nelectrons with the same spin are present\nin the degenerate orbitals of a subshell.\nThese electrons tend to exchange their\npositions and the energy released due to\nthis exchange is called exchange energy.\nThe number of exchanges that can take\nplace is maximum when the subshell\nis either half filled or completely filled\n(Fig. 2.18). As a result the exchange\nenergy is maximum and so is the stability.\nYou may note that the exchange\nenergy is at the basis of Hund’s rule\nthat electrons which enter orbitals of\nequal energy have parallel spins as far\nas possible. In other words, the extra\nstability of half-filled and completely filled\nsubshell is due to: (i) relatively small\nshielding, (ii) smaller coulombic repulsion\nenergy, and (iii) larger exchange energy.\nDetails about the exchange energy will be Fig. 2.18 Possible exchange for a d5\nconfiguration\ndealt with in higher classes.\nReprint 2025-26\nUnit 2.indd 65 9/9/2022 4:28:21 PM\n66 chemistry\nTable 2.6 Electronic Configurations of the Elements\n* Elements with exceptional electronic configurations\nReprint 2025-26\nUnit 2.indd 66 9/9/2022 4:28:22 PM\nstructure of atom 67\n** Elements with atomic number 112 and above have been reported but not yet fully authenticated and named.\nReprint 2025-26\nUnit 2.indd 67 9/9/2022 4:28:23 PM\n68 chemistry\nsUmmary\natoms are the building blocks of elements. They are the smallest parts of an element that\nchemically react. The first atomic theory, proposed by John Dalton in 1808, regarded atom as\nthe ultimate indivisible particle of matter. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, it was\nproved experimentally that atoms are divisible and consist of three fundamental particles:\nelectrons, protons and neutrons. The discovery of sub-atomic particles led to the proposal\nof various atomic models to explain the structure of atom.\nThomson in 1898 proposed that an atom consists of uniform sphere of positive electricity\nwith electrons embedded into it. This model in which mass of the atom is considered to\nbe evenly spread over the atom was proved wrong by Rutherford’s famous alpha-particle\nscattering experiment in 1909. Rutherford concluded that atom is made of a tiny positively\ncharged nucleus, at its centre with electrons revolving around it in circular orbits.\nrutherford model, which resembles the solar system, was no doubt an improvement over\nthomson model but it could not account for the stability of the atom i.e., why the electron\ndoes not fall into the nucleus. Further, it was also silent about the electronic structure of\natoms i.e., about the distribution and relative energies of electrons around the nucleus. The\ndifficulties of the Rutherford model were overcome by Niels Bohr in 1913 in his model of the\nhydrogen atom. Bohr postulated that electron moves around the nucleus in circular orbits.\nOnly certain orbits can exist and each orbit corresponds to a specific energy. Bohr calculated\nthe energy of electron in various orbits and for each orbit predicted the distance between the\nelectron and nucleus. bohr model, though offering a satisfactory model for explaining the\nspectra of the hydrogen atom, could not explain the spectra of multi-electron atoms. The\nreason for this was soon discovered. In Bohr model, an electron is regarded as a charged\nparticle moving in a well defined circular orbit about the nucleus. The wave character of\nthe electron is ignored in Bohr’s theory. An orbit is a clearly defined path and this path can\ncompletely be defined only if both the exact position and the exact velocity of the electron\nat the same time are known. This is not possible according to the Heisenberg uncertainty\nprinciple. Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only ignores the dual behaviour\nof electron but also contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\nErwin Schrödinger, in 1926, proposed an equation called Schrödinger equation to\ndescribe the electron distributions in space and the allowed energy levels in atoms. This\nequation incorporates de Broglie’s concept of wave-particle duality and is consistent with\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle. When Schrödinger equation is solved for the electron in a\nhydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy states the electron can occupy [and\nthe corresponding wave function(s) (ψ) (which in fact are the mathematical functions) of the\nelectron associated with each energy state]. These quantized energy states and corresponding\nwave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers (principal\nquantum number n, azimuthal quantum number l and magnetic quantum number m)\nl\narise as a natural consequence in the solution of the Schrödinger equation. The restrictions\non the values of these three quantum numbers also come naturally from this solution. The\nquantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom successfully predicts all aspects of the\nhydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the\nBohr model.\nAccording to the quantum mechanical model of the atom, the electron distribution of an\natom containing a number of electrons is divided into shells. The shells, in turn, are thought\nto consist of one or more subshells and subshells are assumed to be composed of one or\nmore orbitals, which the electrons occupy. While for hydrogen and hydrogen like systems\n(such as He+, Li2+ etc.) all the orbitals within a given shell have same energy, the energy of\nthe orbitals in a multi-electron atom depends upon the values of n and l: The lower the value\nof (n + l ) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. If two orbitals have the same (n + l ) value,\nthe orbital with lower value of n has the lower energy. In an atom many such orbitals are\nReprint 2025-26\nUnit 2.indd 68 9/9/2022 4:28:23 PM\nstructure of atom 69\npossible and electrons are filled in those orbitals in order of increasing energy in accordance\nwith Pauli exclusion principle (no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four\nquantum numbers) and Hund’s rule of maximum multiplicity (pairing of electrons in the\norbitals belonging to the same subshell does not take place until each orbital belonging to\nthat subshell has got one electron each, i.e., is singly occupied).

These earlier ideas of atom; were mere speculations and there was no way to test understand nature of them experimentally. These ideas remained dormant for electromagnetic radiation and a very long time and were revived again by scientists in Planck s quantum theory; the nineteenth century. Explain the photoelectric effect The atomic theory of matter was first proposed and describe features of atomic on a firm scientific basis by John Dalton, a British spectra; school teacher in 1808. His theory, called Dalton s state the de Broglie relation and atomic theory, regarded the atom as the ultimate Heisenberg uncertainty principle; particle of matter(Unit 1). Dalton s atomic theory was able to explain the law of conservation of mass, law of define an atomic orbital in terms constant composition and law of multiple proportion of quantum numbers; very successfully. However, it failed to explain the results state aufbau principle, Pauli of many experiments, for example, it was known that exclusion principle and Hund s substances like glass or ebonite when rubbed with silk rule of maximum multiplicity; and or fur get electrically charged.

Before we discuss these results we need to keep in mind a basic rule regarding the behaviour of charged particles: Like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other.

These particles were discovered by Chadwick(1932) by bombarding a thin sheet of beryllium by - particles.

Although some of these different kinds of rays were discovered, models were not able to explain the stability besides those mentioned earlier. Wilhalm of atoms, two of these models, one proposed Röentgen(1845 - 1923) in 1895 showed by J. J. Thomson and the other proposed by that when electrons strike a material in Ernest Rutherford are discussed below. The cathode ray tubes, produce rays which can cause fluorescence in the fluorescent 2. 2. 1 thomson model of atom materials placed outside the cathode ray J. J. Thomson, in 1898, proposed that an tubes. Since Röentgen did not know the atom possesses a spherical shape(radius nature of the radiation, he named them approximately 10 10 m) in which the positive X - rays and the name is still carried on. It was charge is uniformly distributed. The electrons noticed that X - rays are produced effectively are embedded into it in such a manner as to when electrons strike the dense metal anode, give the most stable electrostatic arrangement(Fig. 2. 4). Many different names are given called targets. These are not deflected by the to this model, for example, plum pudding, electric and magnetic fields and have a very raisin pudding or watermelon. This model high penetrating power through the matter and that is the reason that these rays are used to study the interior of the objects. These rays are of very short wavelengths(0. 1 nm) and possess electro - magnetic character(Section 2. 3. 1). Henri Becqueral(1852 - 1908) observed that there are certain elements which emit radiation on their own and named this Fig. 2. 4 Thomson model of atom phenomenon as radioactivity and the can be visualised as a pudding or watermelon elements known as radioactive elements. Of positive charge with plums or seeds This field was developed by Marie Curie,(electrons) embedded into it. An important Piere Curie, Rutherford and Fredrick Soddy.

The - rays energy particles from a radioactive source are high energy radiations like X - rays, are was directed at a thin foil(thickness 100 nm) neutral in nature and do not consist of of gold metal. The thin gold foil had a circular particles. As regards penetrating power, fluorescent zinc sulphide screen around it. - particles are the least, followed by - rays Whenever particles struck the screen, a(100 times that of particles) and - rays tiny flash of light was produced at that point.(1000 times of that - particles). The results of scattering experiment were quite unexpected. According to Thomson model of atom, the mass of each gold atom 2. 2. 2 rutherford s nuclear model of atom in the foil should have been spread evenly Rutherford and his students(Hans Geiger over the entire atom, and particles had and Ernest Marsden) bombarded very thin enough energy to pass directly through such a gold foil with particles. Rutherford s famous uniform distribution of mass. It was expected particle scattering experiment is that the particles would slow down and change directions only by a small angles as they passed through the foil. It was observed that:(i) most of the particles passed through the gold foil undeflected.(ii) a small fraction of the particles was deflected by small angles.(i) a very few particles(1 in 20, 000) bounced back, that is, were deflected by A. Rutherford s scattering experiment nearly 180 °. On the basis of the observations, Rutherford drew the following conclusions regarding the structure of atom:(i) Most of the space in the atom is empty as most of the particles passed through the foil undeflected.(ii) A few positively charged particles were deflected. The deflection must be due to enormous repulsive force showing that the positive charge of the atom is not spread throughout the atom as Thomson had presumed. The positive charge has to be concentrated in a very small volume that repelled and deflected the positively charged particles. B.

Mass number(a) of the atom. On the basis of above observations and mass number(a) = number of protons(Z) conclusions, Rutherford proposed the nuclear + number of model of atom. According to this model: neutrons(n)(2. 4)(i) The positive charge and most of the mass 2. 2. 4 isobars and isotopes of the atom was densely concentrated in The composition of any atom can be extremely small region.

In other words(according to together by electrostatic forces of equation 2. 4), it is evident that difference attraction. Between the isotopes is due to the presence 2. 2. 3 atomic number and mass number of different number of neutrons present in the nucleus. For example, considering of The presence of positive charge on the nucleus is due to the protons in the nucleus.

For example, the the one containing 1 proton and 1 neutron number of protons in the hydrogen nucleus is called deuterium(2D, 0. 015 %) and the 1 is 1, in sodium atom it is 11, therefore their other one possessing 1 proton and 2 neutrons atomic numbers are 1 and 11 respectively. Is called tritium(3t). The latter isotope is 1 In order to keep the electrical neutrality, found in trace amounts on the earth. Other the number of electrons in an atom is equal examples of commonly occuring isotopes are: to the number of protons(atomic number, carbon atoms containing 6, 7 and 8 neutrons Z). For example, number of electrons in besides 6 protons(12C, 13C, 14C); chlorine hydrogen atom and sodium atom are 1 and 6 6 6 atoms containing 18 and 20 neutrons besides 11 respectively. 17 protons(35Cl, 37Cl). 17 17 atomic number(Z) = number of protons in Lastly an important point to mention the nucleus of an atom regarding isotopes is that chemical properties = number of electrons of atoms are controlled by the number of in a nuetral atom(2. 3) electrons, which are determined by the number While the positive charge of the nucleus of protons in the nucleus.

Furthermore, a black body is can take energy only in discrete amounts. In thermal equilibrium with its surroundings. All possible energies cannot be taken up or It radiates same amount of energy per unit radiated. Area as it absorbs from its surrounding in It is noteworthy that the first concrete any given time. The amount of light emitted explanation for the phenomenon of the black(intensity of radiation) from a black body body radiation mentioned above was given and its spectral distribution depends only by Max Planck in 1900. Let us first try to on its temperature. At a given temperature, understand this phenomenon, which is given intensity of radiation emitted increases below: with the increase of wavelength, reaches a Hot objects emit electromagnetic maximum value at a given wavelength and radiations over a wide range of wavelengths. Then starts decreasing with further increase of At high temperatures, an appreciable wavelength, as shown in Fig. 2. 8. Also, as the proportion of radiation is in the visible temperature increases, maxima of the curve region of the spectrum. As the temperature shifts to short wavelength. Several attempts is raised, a higher proportion of short were made to predict the intensity of radiation wavelength(blue light) is generated. For as a function of wavelength. Example, when an iron rod is heated in a But the results of the above experiment furnace, it first turns to dull red and then could not be explained satisfactorily on progressively becomes more and more red the basis of the wave theory of light. Max as the temperature increases. As this is Planck arrived at a satisfactory relationship heated further, the radiation emitted becomes white and then becomes blue as the temperature becomes very high. This means that red radiation is most intense at a particular temperature and the blue radiation is more intense at another temperature. This means intensities of radiations of different wavelengths emitted by hot body depend upon its temperature. By late 1850 s it was known that objects made of different material and kept at different temperatures emit different amount of radiation. Also, when the surface of an object is irradiated with light(electromagnetic radiation), a part of radiant energy is generally reflected as such, a part Fig. 2. 8 Wavelength - intensity relationship is absorbed and a part of it is transmitted. The reason for incomplete absorption is that ordinary objects are as a rule imperfect absorbers of radiation. An ideal body, which emits and absorbs radiations of all frequencies uniformly, is called a black body and the radiation emitted by such a body is called black body radiation. In practice, no such body exists. Carbon black approximates fairly closely to black body. A good physical approximation to a black body is a cavity with a tiny hole, which has no other opening.

Energy only in discrete quantities and not Planck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in a continuous manner. He gave the name in 1918 for his quantum theory.

Einstein(1905) was able to explain the Lastly, a more intense beam of light consists photoelectric effect using Planck s quantum of larger number of photons, consequently the theory of electromagnetic radiation as a number of electrons ejected is also larger as starting point.

Phenomena of interference and diffraction. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for The only way to resolve the dilemma was his explanation of the photoelectric effect. To accept the idea that light possesses both particle and wave - like properties, i. e., Shining a beam of light on to a metal light has dual behaviour. Depending on surface can, therefore, be viewed as shooting the experiment, we find that light behaves a beam of particles, the photons. When a either as a wave or as a stream of particles. Photon of sufficient energy strikes an electron Whenever radiation interacts with matter, it in the atom of the metal, it transfers its energy displays particle like properties in contrast instantaneously to the electron during the to the wavelike properties(interference collision and the electron is ejected without and diffraction), which it exhibits when it any time lag or delay. Greater the energy possessed by the photon, greater will be propagates. This concept was totally alien to transfer of energy to the electron and greater the way the scientists thought about matter the kinetic energy of the ejected electron. In and radiation and it took them a long time to other words, kinetic energy of the ejected become convinced of its validity. It turns out, electron is proportional to the frequency as you shall see later, that some microscopic of the electromagnetic radiation.

The light emitted by a sample of excited hydrogen atoms(or any other element) can be passed through a prism and separated into certain discrete wavelengths. Thus an emission spectrum, which is a photographic recording of the separated wavelengths is called as line spectrum. Any sample of reasonable size contains an enormous number of atoms. Although a single atom can be in only one excited state at a time, the collection of atoms contains all possible excited states.

Bohr s model for hydrogen atom is based on the following postulates: i) The electron in the hydrogen atom can move around the nucleus in a circular path of fixed radius and energy. These paths are called orbits, stationary states or allowed energy states. These orbits are arranged concentrically around the nucleus. Ii) The energy of an electron in the orbit does not change with time. However, the electron will move from a lower stationary state to a higher stationary state when required amount of energy is absorbed by the electron or energy is emitted when electron moves from higher stationary state to lower stationary state(equation 2. 16).

In view of these inherent weaknesses in the For a system(such as an atom or a Bohr model, there was no point in extending molecule whose energy does not change with Bohr model to other atoms.

Falling stone, orbiting planets etc., which have Hydrogen Atom and the Schrödinger essentially a particle - like behaviour as shown Equation in the previous section. However it fails when When Schrödinger equation is solved for applied to microscopic objects like electrons, hydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible atoms, molecules etc. This is mainly because energy levels the electron can occupy and of the fact that classical mechanics ignores the corresponding wave function(s)() of the concept of dual behaviour of matter the electron associated with each energy especially for sub - atomic particles and the level.

That is why, as you shall see later on, one talks of only probability of that point. The quantum mechanical results finding the electron at different points in of the hydrogen atom successfully predict an atom. All aspects of the hydrogen atom spectrum 4. An atomic orbital is the wave including some phenomena that could not be function for an electron in an atom. Explained by the Bohr model. Whenever an electron is described by a wave function, we say that the Application of Schrödinger equation to electron occupies that orbital. Since multi - electron atoms presents a difficulty: the many such wave functions are possible Schrödinger equation cannot be solved exactly for an electron, there are many atomic for a multi - electron atom. This difficulty can orbitals in an atom. These one electron be overcome by using approximate methods. Orbital wave functions or orbitals form Such calculations with the aid of modern the basis of the electronic structure computers show that orbitals in atoms other of atoms. In each orbital, the electron than hydrogen do not differ in any radical has a definite energy. An orbital cannot way from the hydrogen orbitals discussed contain more than two electrons. In a above.

An orbital of smaller size means value of n. For example in the first shell(n = 1), there is more chance of finding the electron there is only one sub - shell which corresponds near the nucleus. Similarly shape and to l = 0. There are two sub - shells(l = 0, 1) in orientation mean that there is more probability the second shell(n = 2), three(l = 0, 1, 2) in of finding the electron along certain directions third shell(n = 3) and so on.

There are(2l + 1) orbitals of each In 1925, George Uhlenbeck and Samuel type in a subshell, that is, one s orbital Goudsmit proposed the presence of the fourth(l = 0), three p orbitals(l = 1) and five quantum number known as the electron d orbitals(l = 2) per subshell.

For a given value of l, m has l an electron has, besides charge and mass,(2l + 1) values, the same as the number intrinsic spin angular quantum number. Spin of orbitals per subshell. It means that orbit, orbital and its importance Orbit and orbital are not synonymous. An orbit, as proposed by Bohr, is a circular path around the nucleus in which an electron moves. A precise description of this path of the electron is impossible according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr orbits, therefore, have no real meaning and their existence can never be demonstrated experimentally. An atomic orbital, on the other hand, is a quantum mechanical concept and refers to the one electron wave function in an atom. It is characterized by three quantum numbers(n, l and m) and its value depends upon the coordinates l of the electron. Has, by itself, no physical meaning. It is the square of the wave function i. e., | | 2 which has a physical meaning. | | 2 at any point in an atom gives the value of probability density at that point. Probability density(| | 2) is the probability per unit volume and the product of | | 2 and a small volume(called a volume element) yields the probability of finding the electron in that volume(the reason for specifying a small volume element is that | | 2 varies from one region to another in space but its value can be assumed to be constant within a small volume element). The total probability of finding the electron in a given volume can then be calculated by the sum of all the products of | | 2 and the corresponding volume elements. It is thus possible to get the probable distribution of an electron in an orbital.

Iv) m refers to orientation of the spin of the s electron. Problem 2. 17 What is the total number of orbitals associated with the principal quantum number n = 3? Solution For n = 3, the possible values of l are 0, 1 and 2. Thus there is one 3s orbital(n = 3, l = 0 and m = 0); there are three l 3p orbitals(n = 3, l = 1 and m = 1, 0, l + 1); there are five 3d orbitals(n = 3, l = 2 and m = 2, 1, 0, + 1 +, + 2).

Using the relation; number of orbitals = n2, i. e. 32 = 9. According to the German physicist, Max Born, the square of the wave function Problem 2. 18(i. e., 2) at a point gives the probability density Using s, p, d, f notations, describe the of the electron at that point. The variation orbital with the following quantum of 2 as a function of r for 1s and 2s orbitals numbers is given in Fig. 2. 12(b). Here again, you may(a) n = 2, l = 1,(b) n = 4, l = 0,(c) n = 5, note that the curves for 1s and 2s orbitals l = 3,(d) n = 3, l = 2 are different.

In an atom has no physical meaning. It In general, it has been found that ns - orbital is simply a mathematical function of the has(n 1) nodes, that is, number of nodes coordinates of the electron. However, for increases with increase of principal quantum different orbitals the plots of corresponding number n. In other words, number of nodes wave functions as a function of r(the distance for 2s orbital is one, two for 3s and so on. From the nucleus) are different. Fig. 2. 12(a), These probability density variation can be gives such plots for 1s(n = 1, l = 0) and 2s visualised in terms of charge cloud diagrams(n = 2, l = 0) orbitals.[Fig. 2. 13(a)]. In these diagrams, the density Reprint 2025 - 26 Unit 2. indd 57 9 / 9 / 2022 4: 28: 17 PM 58 chemistry of the dots in a region represents electron probability density in that region. Boundary surface diagrams of constant probability density for different orbitals give a fairly good representation of the shapes of the orbitals. In this representation, a boundary surface or contour surface is drawn in space for an orbital on which the value of probability density | | 2 is constant. In principle many such boundary surfaces may be possible. However, for a given orbital, only that boundary surface diagram of constant probability density * is taken to be good representation of the shape of the orbital which encloses a region or volume in Fig. 2. 13(a) Probability density plots of 1s and which the probability of finding the electron 2s atomic orbitals. The density of the is very high, say, 90 %. The boundary surface dots represents the probability density diagram for 1s and 2s orbitals are given in of finding the electron in that region. Fig. 2. 13(b). One may ask a question: Why(b) Boundary surface diagram for 1s do we not draw a boundary surface diagram, and 2s orbitals. Which bounds a region in which the probability of finding the electron is, 100 %? The answer to this question is that the probability density | | 2 has always some value, howsoever small it may be, at any finite distance from the nucleus. It is therefore, not possible to draw a boundary surface diagram of a rigid size in which the probability of finding the electron is 100 %. Boundary surface diagram for a s orbital is actually a sphere centred on the nucleus. In two dimensions, this sphere looks like a circle. It encloses a region in which probability of finding the electron is about 90 %. Thus, we see that 1s and 2s orbitals are spherical in shape. In reality all the s - orbitals are spherically symmetric, that is, the probability of finding the electron at a given Fig. 2. 14 Boundary surface diagrams of the distance is equal in all the directions. It is also three 2p orbitals. Observed that the size of the s orbital increases with increase in n, that is, 4s > 3s > 2s > 1s these diagrams, the nucleus is at the origin.

The size, shape and there are three possible values of m, there l energy of the three orbitals are identical. Are, therefore, three p orbitals whose axes They differ however, in the way the lobes are are mutually perpendicular. Like s orbitals, oriented. Since the lobes may be considered to p orbitals increase in size and energy with lie along the x, y or z axis, they are given the increase in the principal quantum number designations 2p, 2p, and 2p. It should be and hence the order of the energy and size of x y z understood, however, that there is no simple various p orbitals is 4p > 3p > 2p. Further, like relation between the values of m(1, 0 and + 1) s orbitals, the probability density functions for l and the x, y and z directions. For our purpose, p - orbital also pass through value zero, besides at zero and infinite distance, as the distance from the nucleus increases. The number of nodes are given by the n 2, that is number of radial node is 1 for 3p orbital, two for 4p orbital and so on. For l = 2, the orbital is known as d - orbital and the minimum value of principal quantum number(n) has to be 3. As the value of l cannot be greater than n 1. There are five m values l(2, 1, 0, + 1 and + 2) for l = 2 and thus there are five d orbitals. The boundary surface diagram of d orbitals are shown in Fig. 2. 15. The five d - orbitals are designated as d, xy d, d, d and d. The shapes of the first yz xz x2 y2 z2 four d - orbitals are similar to each other, where as that of the fifth one, d, is different from z2 others, but all five 3d orbitals are equivalent in energy. The d orbitals for which n is greater than 3(4d, 5d.) also have shapes similar to 3d orbital, but differ in energy and size. Besides the radial nodes(i. e., probability density function is zero), the probability density functions for the np and nd orbitals are zero at the plane(s), passing through the nucleus(origin). For example, in case of p z orbital, xy - plane is a nodal plane, in case of d orbital, there are two nodal planes passing xy through the origin and bisecting the xy plane containing z - axis. These are called angular nodes and number of angular nodes are given by l, i. e., one angular node for p orbitals, two angular nodes for d orbitals and so on. The total number of nodes are given by(n 1), i. e., sum of l angular nodes and(n l 1) radial nodes. 2. 6. 3 energies of orbitals Fig. 2. 15 Boundary surface diagrams of the five The energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom 3d orbitals. Is determined solely by the principal quantum Reprint 2025 - 26 Unit 2. indd 59 9 / 9 / 2022 4: 28: 20 PM 60 chemistry number. Thus the energy of the orbitals in The energy of an electron in a multi - hydrogen atom increases as follows: electron atom, unlike that of the hydrogen atom, depends not only on its principal 1s < 2s = 2p < 3s = 3p = 3d < 4s = 4p = 4d quantum number(shell), but also on its = 4f <(2. 23) azimuthal quantum number(subshell). That and is depicted in Fig. 2. 16. Although the is, for a given principal quantum number, s, shapes of 2s and 2p orbitals are different, p, d, f. All have different energies. Within an electron has the same energy when it is a given principal quantum number, the in the 2s orbital as when it is present in 2p energy of orbitals increases in the order orbital. The orbitals having the same energy s < p < d < f. For higher energy levels, these are called degenerate. The 1s orbital in a differences are sufficiently pronounced and hydrogen atom, as said earlier, corresponds straggering of orbital energy may result, to the most stable condition and is called the e. g., 4s < 3d and 6s < 5d; 4f < 6p. The main ground state and an electron residing in this reason for having different energies of the orbital is most strongly held by the nucleus. Subshells is the mutual repulsion among the An electron in the 2s, 2p or higher orbitals in electrons in multi - electron atoms. The only a hydrogen atom is in excited state. Electrical interaction present in hydrogen atom is the attraction between the negatively charged electron and the positively charged nucleus. In multi - electron atoms, besides the presence of attraction between the electron and nucleus, there are repulsion terms between every electron and other electrons present in the atom. Thus the stability of an electron in a multi - electron atom is because total attractive interactions are more than the repulsive interactions. In general, the repulsive interaction of the electrons in the outer shell with the electrons in the inner shell are more important. On the other hand, the attractive interactions of an electron increases with increase of positive charge(Ze) on the nucleus. Due to the presence of electrons in the inner shells, the electron in the outer shell will not experience the full positive charge of the nucleus(Ze). The effect will be lowered due to the partial screening of positive charge on the nucleus by the inner shell electrons. This is known as the shielding of the outer Fig. 2. 16 Energy level diagrams for the few shell electrons from the nucleus by the electronic shells of(a) hydrogen atom inner shell electrons, and the net positive and(b) multi - electronic atoms. Note that charge experienced by the outer electrons is orbitals for the same value of principal known as effective nuclear charge(Z e). Quantum number, have the same eff Despite the shielding of the outer electrons energies even for different azimuthal quantum number for hydrogen atom. From the nucleus by the inner shell electrons, In case of multi - electron atoms, orbitals the attractive force experienced by the outer with same principal quantum number shell electrons increases with increase of possess different energies for different nuclear charge. In other words, the energy of azimuthal quantum numbers. Interaction between, the nucleus and electron Reprint 2025 - 26 Unit 2. indd 60 9 / 9 / 2022 4: 28: 20 PM structure of atom 61(that is orbital energy) decreases(that is table 2. 5 arrangement of orbitals with more negative) with the increase of atomic increasing energy on the basis number(Z). Of(n + l) rule Both the attractive and repulsive interactions depend upon the shell and shape of the orbital in which the electron is present. For example electrons present in spherical shaped, s orbital shields the outer electrons from the nucleus more effectively as compared to electrons present in p orbital. Similarly electrons present in p orbitals shield the outer electrons from the nucleus more than the electrons present in d orbitals, even though all these orbitals are present in the same shell. Further within a shell, due to spherical shape of s orbital, the s orbital electron spends more time close to the nucleus in comparison to p orbital electron which spends more time in the vicinity of nucleus in comparison to d orbital electron. In other words, for a given shell(principal quantum number), the Z eff experienced by the electron decreases with increase of azimuthal quantum number(l), that is, the s orbital electron will be more tightly bound to the nucleus than p orbital electron which in turn will be better tightly bound than the d orbital electron. The energy of electrons in s orbital will be lower(more negative) than that of p orbital electron which will have less energy than that of d orbital electron and so on. Since the extent same energy. Lastly it may be mentioned here of shielding from the nucleus is different for that energies of the orbitals in the same electrons in different orbitals, it leads to the subshell decrease with increase in the splitting of energy levels within the same atomic number(Z). For example, energy of eff shell(or same principal quantum number), 2s orbital of hydrogen atom is greater than that is, energy of electron in an orbital, as that of 2s orbital of lithium and that of lithium mentioned earlier, depends upon the values is greater than that of sodium and so on, that of n and l. Mathematically, the dependence is, E(H) > E(Li) > E(Na) > E(K). 2s 2s 2s 2s of energies of the orbitals on n and l are quite 2. 6. 4 filling of orbitals in atom complicated but one simple rule is that, the lower the value of(n + l) for an orbital, the The filling of electrons into the orbitals of lower is its energy. If two orbitals have different atoms takes place according to the same value of(n + l), the orbital with the aufbau principle which is based on the lower value of n will have the lower energy.

The word aufbau in German means building However, in hydrogen atom, these have the up. The building up of orbitals means the Reprint 2025 - 26 Unit 2. indd 61 9 / 9 / 2022 4: 28: 20 PM 62 chemistry filling up of orbitals with electrons. The the top, the direction of the arrows gives the principle states: In the ground state of the order of filling of orbitals, that is starting atoms, the orbitals are filled in order of from right top to bottom left. With respect to their increasing energies. In other words, placement of outermost valence electrons, electrons first occupy the lowest energy orbital it is remarkably accurate for all atoms. For available to them and enter into higher energy example, valence electron in potassium orbitals only after the lower energy orbitals must choose between 3d and 4s orbitals and are filled. As you have learnt above, energy as predicted by this sequence, it is found of a given orbital depends upon effective in 4s orbital. The above order should be nuclear charge and different type of orbitals assumed to be a rough guide to the filling are affected to different extent. Thus, there of energy levels. In many cases, the orbitals is no single ordering of energies of orbitals are similar in energy and small changes in which will be universally correct for all atoms. Atomic structure may bring about a change in the order of filling. Even then, the above However, following order of energies of series is a useful guide to the building of the the orbitals is extremely useful: electronic structure of an atom provided that 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, it is remembered that exceptions may occur. 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s. Pauli Exclusion Principle The order may be remembered by using the method given in Fig. 2. 17. Starting from The number of electrons to be filled in various orbitals is restricted by the exclusion principle, given by the Austrian scientist Wolfgang Pauli(1926). According to this principle: No two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. Pauli exclusion principle can also be stated as: Only two electrons may exist in the same orbital and these electrons must have opposite spin. This means that the two electrons can have the same value of three quantum numbers n, l and m, but must have the opposite spin l quantum number. The restriction imposed by Pauli s exclusion principle on the number of electrons in an orbital helps in calculating the capacity of electrons to be present in any subshell. For example, subshell 1s comprises one orbital and thus the maximum number of electrons present in 1s subshell can be two, in p and d subshells, the maximum number of electrons can be 6 and 10 and so on. This can be summed up as: the maximum number of electrons in the shell with principal quantum number n is equal to 2n2. Hund s Rule of Maximum Multiplicity This rule deals with the filling of electrons into the orbitals belonging to the same subshell(that is, orbitals of equal energy, called Fig. 2. 17 Order of filling of orbitals degenerate orbitals).

This process The electronic configuration of different is completed with the neon atom. The orbital atoms can be represented in two ways. For picture of these elements can be represented example: as follows:(i) sapbdc. Notation(ii) Orbital diagram s p d In the first notation, the subshell is represented by the respective letter symbol and the number of electrons present in the subshell is depicted, as the super script, like a, b, c,.

The elements filled shells are known as core electrons and after uranium(U) are all short - lived and all of the electrons that are added to the electronic them are produced artificially. The electronic shell with the highest principal quantum configurations of the known elements(as number are called valence electrons. For determined by spectroscopic methods) are example, the electrons in Ne are the core tabulated in Table 2. 6(page 66). Electrons and the electrons from Na to Ar are One may ask what is the utility of knowing the valence electrons. In potassium(K) and the electron configuration?

Symmetrical distribution of electrons: It is well known that symmetry leads to stability. The completely filled or half filled subshells have symmetrical distribution of electrons in them and are therefore more stable. Electrons in the same subshell(here 3d) have equal energy but different spatial distribution. Consequently, their shielding of one - another is relatively small and the electrons are more strongly attracted by the nucleus. 2. Exchange Energy: The stabilizing effect arises whenever two or more electrons with the same spin are present in the degenerate orbitals of a subshell. These electrons tend to exchange their positions and the energy released due to this exchange is called exchange energy. The number of exchanges that can take place is maximum when the subshell is either half filled or completely filled(Fig. 2. 18). As a result the exchange energy is maximum and so is the stability. You may note that the exchange energy is at the basis of Hund s rule that electrons which enter orbitals of equal energy have parallel spins as far as possible. In other words, the extra stability of half - filled and completely filled subshell is due to:(i) relatively small shielding,(ii) smaller coulombic repulsion energy, and(i) larger exchange energy. Details about the exchange energy will be Fig. 2. 18 Possible exchange for a d5 configuration dealt with in higher classes.

The first atomic theory, proposed by John Dalton in 1808, regarded atom as the ultimate indivisible particle of matter. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, it was proved experimentally that atoms are divisible and consist of three fundamental particles: electrons, protons and neutrons. The discovery of sub - atomic particles led to the proposal of various atomic models to explain the structure of atom. Thomson in 1898 proposed that an atom consists of uniform sphere of positive electricity with electrons embedded into it. This model in which mass of the atom is considered to be evenly spread over the atom was proved wrong by Rutherford s famous alpha - particle scattering experiment in 1909. Rutherford concluded that atom is made of a tiny positively charged nucleus, at its centre with electrons revolving around it in circular orbits. Rutherford model, which resembles the solar system, was no doubt an improvement over thomson model but it could not account for the stability of the atom i. e., why the electron does not fall into the nucleus. Further, it was also silent about the electronic structure of atoms i. e., about the distribution and relative energies of electrons around the nucleus. The difficulties of the Rutherford model were overcome by Niels Bohr in 1913 in his model of the hydrogen atom. Bohr postulated that electron moves around the nucleus in circular orbits. Only certain orbits can exist and each orbit corresponds to a specific energy. Bohr calculated the energy of electron in various orbits and for each orbit predicted the distance between the electron and nucleus. Bohr model, though offering a satisfactory model for explaining the spectra of the hydrogen atom, could not explain the spectra of multi - electron atoms. The reason for this was soon discovered. In Bohr model, an electron is regarded as a charged particle moving in a well defined circular orbit about the nucleus. The wave character of the electron is ignored in Bohr s theory. An orbit is a clearly defined path and this path can completely be defined only if both the exact position and the exact velocity of the electron at the same time are known. This is not possible according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only ignores the dual behaviour of electron but also contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Erwin Schrödinger, in 1926, proposed an equation called Schrödinger equation to describe the electron distributions in space and the allowed energy levels in atoms. This equation incorporates de Broglie s concept of wave - particle duality and is consistent with Heisenberg uncertainty principle. When Schrödinger equation is solved for the electron in a hydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy states the electron can occupy[and the corresponding wave function(s)()(which in fact are the mathematical functions) of the electron associated with each energy state]. These quantized energy states and corresponding wave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers(principal quantum number n, azimuthal quantum number l and magnetic quantum number m) l arise as a natural consequence in the solution of the Schrödinger equation. The restrictions on the values of these three quantum numbers also come naturally from this solution. The quantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom successfully predicts all aspects of the hydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the Bohr model. According to the quantum mechanical model of the atom, the electron distribution of an atom containing a number of electrons is divided into shells. The shells, in turn, are thought to consist of one or more subshells and subshells are assumed to be composed of one or more orbitals, which the electrons occupy. While for hydrogen and hydrogen like systems(such as He +, Li2 + etc.) all the orbitals within a given shell have same energy, the energy of the orbitals in a multi - electron atom depends upon the values of n and l: The lower the value of(n + l) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. If two orbitals have the same(n + l) value, the orbital with lower value of n has the lower energy. In an atom many such orbitals are Reprint 2025 - 26 Unit 2. indd 68 9 / 9 / 2022 4: 28: 23 PM structure of atom 69 possible and electrons are filled in those orbitals in order of increasing energy in accordance with Pauli exclusion principle(no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers) and Hund s rule of maximum multiplicity(pairing of electrons in the orbitals belonging to the same subshell does not take place until each orbital belonging to that subshell has got one electron each, i. e., is singly occupied). This forms the basis of the electronic structure of atoms.

Modern Periodic table arranges\nthe elements in the order of their atomic numbers in seven horizontal rows (periods) and\neighteen vertical columns (groups or families). Atomic numbers in a period are consecutive,\nwhereas in a group they increase in a pattern. Elements of the same group have similar\nvalence shell electronic configuration and, therefore, exhibit similar chemical properties.\nHowever, the elements of the same period have incrementally increasing number of electrons\nfrom left to right, and, therefore, have different valencies. Four types of elements can be\nrecognized in the periodic table on the basis of their electronic configurations. These are\ns-block, p-block, d-block and f-block elements. Hydrogen with one electron in the 1s orbital\noccupies a unique position in the periodic table. metals comprise more than seventy eight\nper cent of the known elements. non-metals, which are located at the top of the periodic\ntable, are less than twenty in number. Elements which lie at the border line between metals\nand non-metals (e.g., Si, Ge, As) are called metalloids or semi-metals. Metallic character\nincreases with increasing atomic number in a group whereas decreases from left to right\nin a period. The physical and chemical properties of elements vary periodically with their\natomic numbers.\nPeriodic trends are observed in atomic sizes, ionization enthalpies, electron gain\nenthalpies, electronegativity and valence. The atomic radii decrease while going from\nleft to right in a period and increase with atomic number in a group. Ionization enthalpies\ngenerally increase across a period and decrease down a group. Electronegativity also shows\na similar trend. Electron gain enthalpies, in general, become more negative across a period\nand less negative down a group. There is some periodicity in valence, for example, among\nrepresentative elements, the valence is either equal to the number of electrons in the\noutermost orbitals or eight minus this number. Chemical reactivity is highest at the two\nextremes of a period and is lowest in the centre. The reactivity on the left extreme of a period\nis because of the ease of electron loss (or low ionization enthalpy). Highly reactive elements\ndo not occur in nature in free state; they usually occur in the combined form. Oxides formed\nof the elements on the left are basic and of the elements on the right are acidic in nature.\nOxides of elements in the centre are amphoteric or neutral.\nUnit 3.indd 95 9/9/2022 4:36:15 PM\n96 chemistry\nEXErCisEs\n3.1 What is the basic theme of organisation in the periodic table?\n3.2 Which important property did Mendeleev use to classify the elements in his periodic\ntable and did he stick to that?\n3.3 What is the basic difference in approach between the Mendeleev’s Periodic Law and\nthe Modern Periodic Law?\n3.4 On the basis of quantum numbers, justify that the sixth period of the periodic table\nshould have 32 elements.\n3.5 In terms of period and group where would you locate the element with Z =114?\n3.6 Write the atomic number of the element present in the third period and seventeenth\ngroup of the periodic table.\n3.7 Which element do you think would have been named by\n(i) Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory\n(ii) Seaborg’s group?\n3.8 Why do elements in the same group have similar physical and chemical properties?\n3.9 What does atomic radius and ionic radius really mean to you?\n3.10 How do atomic radius vary in a period and in a group?

Of elements; We know by now that the elements are the basic units of compare the reactivity of elements all types of matter. In 1800, only 31 elements were known. And correlate it with their occurrence in nature; By 1865, the number of identified elements had more than doubled to 63. At present 114 elements are known. Of explain the relationship between ionization enthalpy and metallic them, the recently discovered elements are man - made. Character; Efforts to synthesise new elements are continuing. With use scientific vocabulary such a large number of elements it is very difficult to appropriately to communicate study individually the chemistry of all these elements and ideas related to certain important their innumerable compounds individually. To ease out properties of atoms e. g., this problem, scientists searched for a systematic way to atomic / ionic radii, ionization organise their knowledge by classifying the elements. Not enthalpy, electron gain enthalpy, only that it would rationalize known chemical facts about electronegativity, valence of elements, but even predict new ones for undertaking elements.

This Classification also did not attract much attention. The English chemist, John Alexander Newlands Classification of elements into groups and development of Periodic Law and Periodic in 1865 profounded the law of octaves. He arranged the elements in increasing order Table are the consequences of systematising of their atomic weights and noted that every the knowledge gained by a number of eighth element had properties similar to the scientists through their observations and first element(Table 3. 2). The relationship was experiments. The German chemist, Johann just like every eighth note that resembles the Dobereiner in early 1800 s was the first to first in octaves of music. Newlands s Law of consider the idea of trends among properties Octaves seemed to be true only for elements of elements. By 1829 he noted a similarity up to calcium. Although his idea was not among the physical and chemical properties widely accepted at that time, he, for his work, of several groups of three elements(triads). In was later awarded Davy Medal in 1887 by the each case, he noticed that the middle element Royal Society, London. Of each of the triads had an atomic weight about half way between the atomic weights of The Periodic Law, as we know it today the other two(Table 3. 1). Also the properties owes its development to the Russian chemist, of the middle element were in between those Dmitri Mendeleev(1834 - 1907) and the of the other two members.

However, his work was not For example, iodine with lower atomic weight published until after the work of Dmitri than that of tellurium(Group VI) was placed Mendeleev, the scientist who is generally in Group VII along with fluorine, chlorine, credited with the development of the Modern bromine because of similarities in properties Periodic Table.(Fig. 3. 1). At the same time, keeping his While Dobereiner initiated the study of primary aim of arranging the elements of periodic relationship, it was Mendeleev who similar properties in the same group, he was responsible for publishing the Periodic proposed that some of the elements were Law for the first time. It states as follows: still undiscovered and, therefore, left several gaps in the table. For example, both gallium The properties of the elements are and germanium were unknown at the time a periodic function of their atomic Mendeleev published his Periodic Table. Weights. He left the gap under aluminium and a gap Mendeleev arranged elements in horizontal under silicon, and called these elements rows and vertical columns of a table in order Eka - aluminium and Eka - silicon.

Metals are of Elements usually solids at room temperature[mercury There are many observable patterns in the is an exception; gallium and caesium also physical and chemical properties of elements have very low melting points(303K and as we descend in a group or move across a 302K, respectively)]. Metals usually have high period in the Periodic Table. For example, melting and boiling points. They are good within a period, chemical reactivity tends to conductors of heat and electricity. They are be high in Group 1 metals, lower in elements malleable(can be flattened into thin sheets by towards the middle of the table, and increases hammering) and ductile(can be drawn into to a maximum in the Group 17 non - metals.

Metals(say alkali metals) reactivity increases In fact, in a horizontal row, the property of on moving down the group, whereas within a elements change from metallic on the left to group of non - metals(say halogens), reactivity non - metallic on the right. Non - metals are decreases down the group. But why do the usually solids or gases at room temperature properties of elements follow these trends? With low melting and boiling points(boron And how can we explain periodicity? To and carbon are exceptions). They are poor answer these questions, we must look into the conductors of heat and electricity. Most non - theories of atomic structure and properties metallic solids are brittle and are neither of the atom. In this section we shall discuss malleable nor ductile. The elements become the periodic trends in certain physical and more metallic as we go down a group; the chemical properties and try to explain them non - metallic character increases as one goes in terms of number of electrons and energy from left to right across the Periodic table. Levels.

The elements(e. g., elements such as melting and boiling points, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and heats of fusion and vaporization, energy tellurium) bordering this line and running of atomization, etc. Which show periodic diagonally across the Periodic table show variations. However, we shall discuss the properties that are characteristic of both periodic trends with respect to atomic and metals and non - metals. These elements are ionic radii, ionization enthalpy, electron gain called semi - metals or metalloids. Enthalpy and electronegativity. Problem 3. 4(a) Atomic Radius Considering the atomic number and You can very well imagine that finding the position in the periodic table, arrange size of an atom is a lot more complicated than the following elements in the increasing measuring the radius of a ball. Do you know order of metallic character: Si, Be, Mg, why? Firstly, because the size of an atom Na, P.(~ 1. 2 Å i. e., 1. 2 × 10 10 m in radius) is very Unit 3. indd 85 9 / 9 / 2022 4: 36: 14 PM 86 chemistry small. Secondly, since the electron cloud The atomic radii of a few elements are listed surrounding the atom does not have a sharp in Table 3. 6. Two trends are obvious. We can boundary, the determination of the atomic explain these trends in terms of nuclear charge size cannot be precise. In other words, there and energy level. The atomic size generally is no practical way by which the size of an decreases across a period as illustrated in individual atom can be measured. However, Fig. 3. 4(a) for the elements of the second an estimate of the atomic size can be made by period. It is because within the period the knowing the distance between the atoms in outer electrons are in the same valence shell the combined state. One practical approach to and the effective nuclear charge increases estimate the size of an atom of a non - metallic as the atomic number increases resulting in element is to measure the distance between the increased attraction of electrons to the two atoms when they are bound together nucleus. Within a family or vertical column by a single bond in a covalent molecule and of the periodic table, the atomic radius from this value, the Covalent radius of the increases regularly with atomic number as element can be calculated. For example, the illustrated in Fig. 3. 4(b). For alkali metals bond distance in the chlorine molecule(Cl) 2 and halogens, as we descend the groups, is 198 pm and half this distance(99 pm), is the principal quantum number(n) increases taken as the atomic radius of chlorine. For and the valence electrons are farther from metals, we define the term metallic radius the nucleus. This happens because the inner which is taken as half the internuclear energy levels are filled with electrons, which distance separating the metal cores in the serve to shield the outer electrons from the metallic crystal. For example, the distance pull of the nucleus. Consequently the size of between two adjacent copper atoms in solid the atom increases as reflected in the atomic copper is 256 pm; hence the metallic radius radii. Of copper is assigned a value of 128 pm. For simplicity, in this book, we use the term Note that the atomic radii of noble gases atomic radius to refer to both covalent or are not considered here. Being monoatomic, metallic radius depending on whether the their(non - bonded radii) values are very element is a non - metal or a metal. Atomic large. In fact radii of noble gases should be radii can be measured by X - ray or other compared not with the covalent radii but with spectroscopic methods. The van der Waals radii of other elements.

Therefore, it is the actual charge on the nucleus because of easier to remove the 2p - electron from boron shielding or screening of the valence compared to the removal of a 2s - electron from electron from the nucleus by the intervening beryllium. Thus, boron has a smaller first core electrons. For example, the 2s electron ionization enthalpy than beryllium.

Electronegativity generally increases across a period from left to right(say from lithium to fluorine) and decrease down a group(say from fluorine to astatine) in the periodic table. How can these trends be explained? Can the electronegativity be related to atomic radii, which tend to decrease across each period from left to right, but increase down each group? The attraction between the outer(or valence) electrons and the nucleus increases as the atomic radius decreases in a period. The electronegativity also increases.

To as diagonal relationship in the periodic properties.(b) Anomalous Properties of Second Period Elements What are the reasons for the different chemical behaviour of the first member of The first element of each of the groups 1 a group of elements in the s - and p - blocks(lithium) and 2(beryllium) and groups 13 - 17 compared to that of the subsequent members(boron to fluorine) differs in many respects in the same group? The anomalous behaviour from the other members of their respective is attributed to their small size, large charge / group. For example, lithium unlike other radius ratio and high electronegativity of the alkali metals, and beryllium unlike other elements. In addition, the first member of alkaline earth metals, form compounds with group has only four valence orbitals(2s and pronounced covalent character; the other 2p) available for bonding, whereas the second members of these groups predominantly member of the groups have nine valence form ionic compounds. In fact the behaviour orbitals(3s, 3p, 3d). As a consequence of of lithium and beryllium is more similar with this, the maximum covalency of the first member of each group is 4(e. g., boron Property Element can only form BF, whereas the other 4 members of the groups can expand their Metallic radius M / pm li Be B valence shell to accommodate more than 152 111 88 four pairs of electrons e. g., aluminium na mg al Alf 3 forms).

No. The oxidation state of Al is + 3 and the covalency is 6. The chemical reactivity of an element can be best shown by its reactions with oxygen and 3. 7. 3 Periodic trends and Chemical halogens. Here, we shall consider the reaction reactivity of the elements with oxygen only. Elements on two extremes of a period easily combine We have observed the periodic trends in with oxygen to form oxides. The normal oxide certain fundamental properties such as formed by the element on extreme left is the atomic and ionic radii, ionization enthalpy, most basic(e. g., Na O), whereas that formed electron gain enthalpy and valence.

Or basic properties. The atomic and ionic radii, as we know, Problem 3. 10 generally decrease in a period from left to right. As a consequence, the ionization enthalpies Show by a chemical reaction with water that Na O is a basic oxide and Cl O is generally increase(with some exceptions as 2 2 7 an acidic oxide. Outlined in section 3. 7. 1(a)) and electron gain enthalpies become more negative across a solution period. In other words, the ionization enthalpy Na O with water forms a strong base 2 of the extreme left element in a period is the whereas Cl O forms strong acid. 2 7 least and the electron gain enthalpy of the Na O + H O 2NaOH 2 2 element on the extreme right is the highest Cl O + H O 2HClO 2 7 2 4 negative(note: noble gases having completely Their basic or acidic nature can be filled shells have rather positive electron qualitatively tested with litmus paper.

Thus, the maximum Among transition metals(3d series), the chemical reactivity at the extreme left(among change in atomic radii is much smaller as alkali metals) is exhibited by the loss of an compared to those of representative elements electron leading to the formation of a cation across the period. The change in atomic radii and at the extreme right(among halogens) is still smaller among inner - transition metals shown by the gain of an electron forming(4f series). The ionization enthalpies are an anion. This property can be related with intermediate between those of s - and p - blocks.

This trend can be related generally results in a gradual decrease in with their reducing and oxidizing property ionization enthalpies and a regular decrease which you will learn later. In the case of(with exception in some third period elements transition elements, however, a reverse trend as shown in section 3. 7. 1(d)) in electron is observed. This can be explained in terms of gain enthalpies in the case of main group atomic size and ionization enthalpy. Elements. Thus, the metallic character Summary In this Unit, you have studied the development of the Periodic law and the Periodic table. Mendeleev s Periodic table was based on atomic masses. Modern Periodic table arranges the elements in the order of their atomic numbers in seven horizontal rows(periods) and eighteen vertical columns(groups or families). Atomic numbers in a period are consecutive, whereas in a group they increase in a pattern. Elements of the same group have similar valence shell electronic configuration and, therefore, exhibit similar chemical properties. However, the elements of the same period have incrementally increasing number of electrons from left to right, and, therefore, have different valencies. Four types of elements can be recognized in the periodic table on the basis of their electronic configurations. These are s - block, p - block, d - block and f - block elements. Hydrogen with one electron in the 1s orbital occupies a unique position in the periodic table. Metals comprise more than seventy eight per cent of the known elements. Non - metals, which are located at the top of the periodic table, are less than twenty in number. Elements which lie at the border line between metals and non - metals(e. g., Si, Ge, As) are called metalloids or semi - metals. Metallic character increases with increasing atomic number in a group whereas decreases from left to right in a period. The physical and chemical properties of elements vary periodically with their atomic numbers. Periodic trends are observed in atomic sizes, ionization enthalpies, electron gain enthalpies, electronegativity and valence. The atomic radii decrease while going from left to right in a period and increase with atomic number in a group. Ionization enthalpies generally increase across a period and decrease down a group. Electronegativity also shows a similar trend. Electron gain enthalpies, in general, become more negative across a period and less negative down a group. There is some periodicity in valence, for example, among representative elements, the valence is either equal to the number of electrons in the outermost orbitals or eight minus this number. Chemical reactivity is highest at the two extremes of a period and is lowest in the centre. The reactivity on the left extreme of a period is because of the ease of electron loss(or low ionization enthalpy). Highly reactive elements do not occur in nature in free state; they usually occur in the combined form. Oxides formed of the elements on the left are basic and of the elements on the right are acidic in nature. Oxides of elements in the centre are amphoteric or neutral.

This gives the concept\nof electrovalency.\nThe first description of covalent bonding was provided by Lewis in terms of the sharing\nof electron pairs between atoms and he related the process to the attainment of noble gas\nconfigurations by reacting atoms as a result of sharing of electrons. The Lewis dot symbols\nshow the number of valence electrons of the atoms of a given element and Lewis dot structures\nshow pictorial representations of bonding in molecules.\nAn ionic compound is pictured as a three-dimensional aggregation of positive and negative\nions in an ordered arrangement called the crystal lattice. In a crystalline solid there is a\ncharge balance between the positive and negative ions. The crystal lattice is stabilized by\nthe enthalpy of lattice formation.\nWhile a single covalent bond is formed by sharing of an electron pair between two atoms,\nmultiple bonds result from the sharing of two or three electron pairs. Some bonded atoms\nhave additional pairs of electrons not involved in bonding. These are called lone-pairs of\nelectrons. A Lewis dot structure shows the arrangement of bonded pairs and lone pairs around\neach atom in a molecule. important parameters, associated with chemical bonds, like:\nbond length, bond angle, bond enthalpy, bond order and bond polarity have significant\neffect on the properties of compounds.\nA number of molecules and polyatomic ions cannot be described accurately by a single\nLewis structure and a number of descriptions (representations) based on the same skeletal\nstructure are written and these taken together represent the molecule or ion. This is a very\nimportant and extremely useful concept called resonance. The contributing structures\nor canonical forms taken together constitute the resonance hybrid which represents the\nmolecule or ion.\nReprint 2025-26\nUnit 4.indd 132 9/12/2022 9:36:18 AM\nChemiCal Bonding and moleCular StruCture 133\nThe VSEPR model used for predicting the geometrical shapes of molecules is based on\nthe assumption that electron pairs repel each other and, therefore, tend to remain as far\napart as possible. According to this model, molecular geometry is determined by repulsions\nbetween lone pairs and lone pairs; lone pairs and bonding pairs and bonding pairs and bonding\npairs. The order of these repulsions being : lp-lp > lp-bp > bp-bp\nThe valence bond (vB) approach to covalent bonding is basically concerned with the\nenergetics of covalent bond formation about which the Lewis and VSEPR models are silent.\nBasically the VB theory discusses bond formation in terms of overlap of orbitals. For example\nthe formation of the H molecule from two hydrogen atoms involves the overlap of the 1s\n2\norbitals of the two H atoms which are singly occupied. It is seen that the potential energy\nof the system gets lowered as the two H atoms come near to each other. At the equilibrium\ninter-nuclear distance (bond distance) the energy touches a minimum. Any attempt to bring\nthe nuclei still closer results in a sudden increase in energy and consequent destabilization\nof the molecule. Because of orbital overlap the electron density between the nuclei increases\nwhich helps in bringing them closer. It is however seen that the actual bond enthalpy and\nbond length values are not obtained by overlap alone and other variables have to be taken\ninto account.\nFor explaining the characteristic shapes of polyatomic molecules Pauling introduced the\nconcept of hybridisation of atomic orbitals. sp, sp2, sp3 hybridizations of atomic orbitals\nof Be, B, C, N and O are used to explain the formation and geometrical shapes of molecules\nlike BeCl , BCl , CH , NH and H O. They also explain the formation of multiple bonds in\n2 3 4 3 2\nmolecules like C H and C H .\n2 2 2 4\nThe molecular orbital (MO) theory describes bonding in terms of the combination and\narrangment of atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals that are associated with the molecule\nas a whole. The number of molecular orbitals are always equal to the number of atomic\norbitals from which they are formed. Bonding molecular orbitals increase electron density\nbetween the nuclei and are lower in energy than the individual atomic orbitals. Antibonding\nmolecular orbitals have a region of zero electron density between the nuclei and have more\nenergy than the individual atomic orbitals.\nThe electronic configuration of the molecules is written by filling electrons in the molecular\norbitals in the order of increasing energy levels. As in the case of atoms, the Pauli exclusion\nprinciple and Hund’s rule are applicable for the filling of molecular orbitals. Molecules are\nsaid to be stable if the number of elctrons in bonding molecular orbitals is greater than that\nin antibonding molecular orbitals.\nHydrogen bond is formed when a hydrogen atom finds itself between two highly\nelectronegative atoms such as F, O and N. It may be intermolecular (existing between two\nor more molecules of the same or different substances) or intramolecular (present within\nthe same molecule). Hydrogen bonds have a powerful effect on the structure and properties\nof many compounds.\nEXERCiSES\n4.1 Explain the formation of a chemical bond.\n4.2 Write Lewis dot symbols for atoms of the following elements : Mg, Na, B, O, N, Br.\n4.3 Write Lewis symbols for the following atoms and ions:\nS and S2–; Al and Al3+; H and H–\n4.4 Draw the Lewis structures for the following molecules and ions :\nH S, SiCl , BeF , CO2−, HCOOH\n2 4 2 3\n4.5 Define octet rule.

This number CHEMiCAL Bonding of valence electrons helps to calculate the common or group valence of the element. In order to explain the formation of chemical The group valence of the elements is generally bond in terms of electrons, a number of either equal to the number of dots in Lewis attempts were made, but it was only in symbols or 8 minus the number of dots or 1916 when Kössel and Lewis succeeded valence electrons. Independently in giving a satisfactory explanation. They were the first to provide Kössel, in relation to chemical bonding, some logical explanation of valence which was drew attention to the following facts: based on the inertness of noble gases. In the periodic table, the highly Lewis pictured the atom in terms of a electronegative halogens and the highly positively charged Kernel(the nucleus plus electropositive alkali metals are separated by the noble gases; the inner electrons) and the outer shell that could accommodate a maximum of eight The formation of a negative ion from a electrons. He, further assumed that these halogen atom and a positive ion from eight electrons occupy the corners of a cube an alkali metal atom is associated with which surround the Kernel. Thus the single the gain and loss of an electron by the outer shell electron of sodium would occupy respective atoms; one corner of the cube, while in the case of The negative and positive ions thus a noble gas all the eight corners would be formed attain stable noble gas electronic occupied. This octet of electrons, represents configurations. The noble gases(with the a particularly stable electronic arrangement. Exception of helium which has a duplet Lewis postulated that atoms achieve of electrons) have a particularly stable the stable octet when they are linked by outer shell configuration of eight(octet) chemical bonds.

Important theory of chemical combination Thus in water and carbon tetrachloride between atoms known as electronic theory molecules, formation of covalent bonds of chemical bonding. According to this, can be represented as: atoms can combine either by transfer of valence electrons from one atom to another(gaining or losing) or by sharing of valence electrons in order to have an octet in their valence shells. This is known as octet rule. 4. 1. 2 Covalent Bond Langmuir(1919) refined the Lewis postulations by abandoning the idea of the stationary cubical arrangement of the octet, and by introducing the term covalent thus, when two atoms share one bond. The Lewis - Langmuir theory can be electron pair they are said to be joined by understood by considering the formation of a single covalent bond. In many compounds the chlorine molecule, Cl.

Of more than one electron pair between two The formation of the Cl molecule can be 2 atoms. If two atoms share two pairs of understood in terms of the sharing of a pair electrons, the covalent bond between them of electrons between the two chlorine atoms, is called a double bond. For example, in the each chlorine atom contributing one electron carbon dioxide molecule, we have two double to the shared pair. In the process both bonds between the carbon and oxygen atoms.

Writing of Lewis dot structures of molecules is, therefore, very useful. The Lewis dot structures can be written by adopting the following steps: The total number of electrons required for writing the structures are obtained by adding the valence electrons of the combining atoms. For example, in the CH 4 molecule there are eight valence electrons available for bonding(4 from carbon and 4 from the four hydrogen atoms). For anions, each negative charge would mean addition of one electron.

And it applies mainly to the second period 3 elements of the periodic table. There are three The Lewis structure of O may be drawn as: 3 types of exceptions to the octet rule. The incomplete octet of the central atom In some compounds, the number of electrons surrounding the central atom is less than eight. This is especially the case with elements having less than four valence electrons. Examples are Licl, Beh and Bcl. The atoms have been numbered as 1, 2 2 3 and 3. The formal charge on: The central O atom marked 1 1 Li, Be and B have 1, 2 and 3 valence electrons = 6 2(6) = + 1 only. Some other such compounds are Alcl 2 3 and BF. The end O atom marked 2 3 Odd - electron molecules 1 = 6 4(4) = 0 In molecules with an odd number of electrons 2 like nitric oxide, NO and nitrogen dioxide, The end O atom marked 3 NO, the octet rule is not satisfied for all the 2 1 atoms = 6 6(2) = 1 2 Hence, we represent O along with the 3 formal charges as follows: The expanded octet Elements in and beyond the third period of the periodic table have, apart from 3s and 3p orbitals, 3d orbitals also available for bonding. In a number of compounds of these elements there are more than eight valence electrons We must understand that formal charges around the central atom. This is termed as do not indicate real charge separation within the expanded octet. Obviously the octet rule the molecule. Indicating the charges on the does not apply in such cases. Atoms in the Lewis structure only helps in Some of the examples of such compounds keeping track of the valence electrons in are: PF, SF, H SO and a number of the molecule. Formal charges help in the 5 6 2 4 coordination compounds. Selection of the lowest energy structure from a number of possible Lewis structures for a given species. Generally the lowest energy structure is the one with the smallest formal charges on the atoms. The formal charge is a factor based on a pure covalent view of bonding in which electron pairs are shared equally by neighbouring atoms.

The crystal structure of sodium chloride, Nacl(rock salt), for example is From the Kössel and Lewis treatment of the shown below. Formation of an ionic bond, it follows that the formation of ionic compounds would primarily depend upon: The ease of formation of the positive and negative ions from the respective neutral atoms; The arrangement of the positive and negative ions in the solid, that is, the lattice of the crystalline compound. The formation of a positive ion involves ionization, i. e., removal of electron(s) from the neutral atom and that of the negative ion involves the addition of electron(s) to the Rock salt structure neutral atom. In ionic solids, the sum of the electron gain M(g) M +(g) + e; enthalpy and the ionization enthalpy may be Ionization enthalpy positive but still the crystal structure gets X(g) + e X(g); stabilized due to the energy released in the Electron gain enthalpy formation of the crystal lattice.

Thus a qualitative measure of the stability of an ionic compound is provided by its enthalpy of lattice formation and not simply by achieving octet of electrons around the ionic species in gaseous state. Since lattice enthalpy plays a key role in the formation of ionic compounds, it is important that we learn more about it. 4. 2. 1 Lattice Enthalpy the Lattice Enthalpy of an ionic solid is defined as the energy required to completely separate one mole of a solid ionic compound into gaseous constituent ions.

It also does not give any reason for the principles of variation and superposition.

Therefore, for the sake of convenience, although in both the cases a single covalent valence bond theory has been discussed in bond is formed by the sharing of an electron terms of qualitative and non - mathematical pair between the respective atoms. It also treatment only. To start with, let us consider gives no idea about the shapes of polyatomic the formation of hydrogen molecule which is molecules. The simplest of all molecules.

As these two are valence bond(VB) theory and molecular atoms approach each other, new attractive orbital(MO) theory. And repulsive forces begin to operate.

This Fig. 4. 7 Forces of attraction and repulsion partial merging of atomic orbitals is called during the formation of H molecule 2 overlapping of atomic orbitals which results in Experimentally it has been found that the pairing of electrons. The extent of overlap the magnitude of new attractive force is decides the strength of a covalent bond. In more than the new repulsive forces. As a general, greater the overlap the stronger is the result, two atoms approach each other and bond formed between two atoms. Therefore, potential energy decreases. Ultimately a stage is reached where the net force of attraction according to orbital overlap concept, the balances the force of repulsion and system formation of a covalent bond between two acquires minimum energy. At this stage atoms results by pairing of electrons present two hydrogen atoms are said to be bonded in the valence shell having opposite spins.

The molecule of hydrogen is formed due to the overlap of 1s - orbitals of two H atoms. In case of polyatomic molecules like CH, 4 NH and H O, the geometry of the molecules 3 2 is also important in addition to the bond formation. For example why is it so that CH 4 molecule has tetrahedral shape and HCH bond angles are 109. 5 °? Why is the shape of NH molecule pyramidal? 3 The valence bond theory explains the shape, the formation and directional properties of bonds in polyatomic molecules like CH, 4 NH and H O, etc. In terms of overlap and 3 2 hybridisation of atomic orbitals. 4. 5. 3 Overlapping of Atomic Orbitals When orbitals of two atoms come close to form bond, their overlap may be positive, negative or zero depending upon the sign(phase) and direction of orientation of amplitude of orbital wave function in space(Fig. 4. 9). Positive and negative sign on boundary surface diagrams in the Fig. 4. 9 show the sign(phase) of orbital wave function and are not related to charge. Orbitals forming bond should have same sign Fig. 4. 9 Positive, negative and zero overlaps of s and p atomic orbitals(phase) and orientation in space. This is called positive overlap. Various overlaps of s and p hydrogen. The four atomic orbitals of carbon, orbitals are depicted in Fig. 4. 9. Each with an unpaired electron can overlap with the 1s orbitals of the four H atoms which The criterion of overlap, as the main factor are also singly occupied. This will result in the for the formation of covalent bonds applies formation of four C - H bonds. It will, however, uniformly to the homonuclear / heteronuclear be observed that while the three p orbitals of diatomic molecules and polyatomic molecules. Carbon are at 90 ° to one another, the HCH We know that the shapes of CH, NH, and angle for these will also be 90 °. That is three 4 3 H O molecules are tetrahedral, pyramidal C - H bonds will be oriented at 90 ° to one 2 and bent respectively. It would be therefore another. The 2s orbital of carbon and the 1s interesting to use VB theory to find out if these orbital of H are spherically symmetrical and geometrical shapes can be explained in terms they can overlap in any direction. Therefore of the orbital overlaps. The direction of the fourth C - H bond cannot Let us first consider the CH(methane) be ascertained. This description does not fit 4 molecule.

In case of internuclear axis. This is called as head sigma bond, the overlapping of orbitals takes on overlap or axial overlap. This can be place to a larger extent. Hence, it is stronger formed by any one of the following types as compared to the pi bond where the extent of combinations of atomic orbitals. Of overlapping occurs to a smaller extent. S - s overlapping: In this case, there is Further, it is important to note that in the overlap of two half filled s - orbitals along formation of multiple bonds between two the internuclear axis as shown below: atoms of a molecule, pi bond(s) is formed in addition to a sigma bond. 4. 6 Hybridisation In order to explain the characteristic geometrical shapes of polyatomic molecules s - p overlapping: This type of overlap like CH, NH and H O etc., Pauling introduced 4 3 2 occurs between half filled s - orbitals of one the concept of hybridisation. According to him atom and half filled p - orbitals of another the atomic orbitals combine to form new set of atom. Equivalent orbitals known as hybrid orbitals. Unlike pure orbitals, the hybrid orbitals are used in bond formation. The phenomenon is known as hybridisation which can be defined as the process of intermixing of the orbitals of p p overlapping: This type of overlap slightly different energies so as to redistribute takes place between half filled p - orbitals their energies, resulting in the formation of of the two approaching atoms. New set of orbitals of equivalent energies and shape. For example when one 2s and three 2p - orbitals of carbon hybridise, there is the formation of four new sp3 hybrid orbitals. Salient features of hybridisation: The main(ii) pi() bond: In the formation of bond features of hybridisation are as under: the atomic orbitals overlap in such a 1. The number of hybrid orbitals is equal to way that their axes remain parallel to the number of the atomic orbitals that get each other and perpendicular to the internuclear axis.

The suitable orbitals for 3 configuration of central boron atom is sp hybridisation are s and p, if the hybrid z 1s22s22p1. In the excited state, one of the 2s orbitals are to lie along the z - axis. Each sp electrons is promoted to vacant 2p orbital as hybrid orbitals has 50 % s - character and 50 % p - character. Such a molecule in which the central atom is sp - hybridised and linked directly to two other central atoms possesses linear geometry. This type of hybridisation is also known as diagonal hybridisation. The two sp hybrids point in the opposite direction along the z - axis with projecting positive lobes and very small negative lobes, which provides more effective overlapping resulting in the formation of stronger bonds.

Ground state is 2S22p1 x 2p1 y 2p1 z having three These three orbitals(one 2s and two 2p) unpaired electrons in the sp3 hybrid orbitals hybridise to form three sp2 hybrid orbitals. And a lone pair of electrons is present in the The three hybrid orbitals so formed are fourth one. These three hybrid orbitals overlap oriented in a trigonal planar arrangement with 1s orbitals of hydrogen atoms to form and overlap with 2p orbitals of chlorine to three N H sigma bonds.

Of the valence shell to form four sp3 hybrid orbital of equivalent energies and shape. There is 25 % s - character and 75 % p - character in each sp3 hybrid orbital. The four sp3 hybrid orbitals so formed are directed towards the four corners of the tetrahedron. The angle between sp3 hybrid orbital is 109. 5 ° as shown in Fig. 4. 12. Fig. 4. 13 Formation of NH molecule 3 In case of H O molecule, the four oxygen 2 orbitals(one 2s and three 2p) undergo sp3 hybridisation forming four sp3 hybrid orbitals out of which two contain one electron each and the other two contain a pair of electrons. These four sp3 hybrid orbitals acquire a tetrahedral geometry, with two corners occupied by hydrogen atoms while the other two by the lone pairs. The bond angle in this case is reduced to 104. 5 ° from 109. 5 °(Fig. 4. 14) and the molecule thus acquires a V - shape or angular geometry.

Thus, the hydrogen bonds have strong influence on the structure and properties of the compounds. 4. 9. 2 types of H - Bonds There are two types of H - bonds(i) Intermolecular hydrogen bond(ii) Intramolecular hydrogen bond(1) Intermolecular hydrogen bond: It is formed between two different molecules of the Fig. 4. 22 Intramolecular hydrogen bonding in same or different compounds. For example, o - nitrophenol molecule SUMMARy Kössel s first insight into the mechanism of formation of electropositive and electronegative ions related the process to the attainment of noble gas configurations by the respective ions. Electrostatic attraction between ions is the cause for their stability. This gives the concept of electrovalency. The first description of covalent bonding was provided by Lewis in terms of the sharing of electron pairs between atoms and he related the process to the attainment of noble gas configurations by reacting atoms as a result of sharing of electrons. The Lewis dot symbols show the number of valence electrons of the atoms of a given element and Lewis dot structures show pictorial representations of bonding in molecules. An ionic compound is pictured as a three - dimensional aggregation of positive and negative ions in an ordered arrangement called the crystal lattice. In a crystalline solid there is a charge balance between the positive and negative ions. The crystal lattice is stabilized by the enthalpy of lattice formation. While a single covalent bond is formed by sharing of an electron pair between two atoms, multiple bonds result from the sharing of two or three electron pairs. Some bonded atoms have additional pairs of electrons not involved in bonding. These are called lone - pairs of electrons. A Lewis dot structure shows the arrangement of bonded pairs and lone pairs around each atom in a molecule. Important parameters, associated with chemical bonds, like: bond length, bond angle, bond enthalpy, bond order and bond polarity have significant effect on the properties of compounds. A number of molecules and polyatomic ions cannot be described accurately by a single Lewis structure and a number of descriptions(representations) based on the same skeletal structure are written and these taken together represent the molecule or ion. This is a very important and extremely useful concept called resonance. The contributing structures or canonical forms taken together constitute the resonance hybrid which represents the molecule or ion. Reprint 2025 - 26 Unit 4. indd 132 9 / 12 / 2022 9: 36: 18 AM Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure 133 The VSEPR model used for predicting the geometrical shapes of molecules is based on the assumption that electron pairs repel each other and, therefore, tend to remain as far apart as possible. According to this model, molecular geometry is determined by repulsions between lone pairs and lone pairs; lone pairs and bonding pairs and bonding pairs and bonding pairs. The order of these repulsions being: lp - lp > lp - bp > bp - bp The valence bond(Vb) approach to covalent bonding is basically concerned with the energetics of covalent bond formation about which the Lewis and VSEPR models are silent. Basically the VB theory discusses bond formation in terms of overlap of orbitals. For example the formation of the H molecule from two hydrogen atoms involves the overlap of the 1s 2 orbitals of the two H atoms which are singly occupied. It is seen that the potential energy of the system gets lowered as the two H atoms come near to each other. At the equilibrium inter - nuclear distance(bond distance) the energy touches a minimum. Any attempt to bring the nuclei still closer results in a sudden increase in energy and consequent destabilization of the molecule. Because of orbital overlap the electron density between the nuclei increases which helps in bringing them closer. It is however seen that the actual bond enthalpy and bond length values are not obtained by overlap alone and other variables have to be taken into account. For explaining the characteristic shapes of polyatomic molecules Pauling introduced the concept of hybridisation of atomic orbitals. Sp, sp2, sp3 hybridizations of atomic orbitals of Be, B, C, N and O are used to explain the formation and geometrical shapes of molecules like Becl, Bcl, CH, NH and H O. They also explain the formation of multiple bonds in 2 3 4 3 2 molecules like C H and C H. 2 2 2 4 The molecular orbital(MO) theory describes bonding in terms of the combination and arrangment of atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals that are associated with the molecule as a whole. The number of molecular orbitals are always equal to the number of atomic orbitals from which they are formed. Bonding molecular orbitals increase electron density between the nuclei and are lower in energy than the individual atomic orbitals. Antibonding molecular orbitals have a region of zero electron density between the nuclei and have more energy than the individual atomic orbitals. The electronic configuration of the molecules is written by filling electrons in the molecular orbitals in the order of increasing energy levels. As in the case of atoms, the Pauli exclusion principle and Hund s rule are applicable for the filling of molecular orbitals. Molecules are said to be stable if the number of elctrons in bonding molecular orbitals is greater than that in antibonding molecular orbitals. Hydrogen bond is formed when a hydrogen atom finds itself between two highly electronegative atoms such as F, O and N. It may be intermolecular(existing between two or more molecules of the same or different substances) or intramolecular(present within the same molecule). Hydrogen bonds have a powerful effect on the structure and properties of many compounds.

For these purposes, we divide\nthe universe into the system and the surroundings. Chemical or physical processes lead to evolution\nor absorption of heat (q), part of which may be converted into work (w). These quantities are related\nthrough the first law of thermodynamics via ∆U = q + w. ∆U, change in internal energy, depends\non initial and final states only and is a state function, whereas q and w depend on the path and\nare not the state functions. We follow sign conventions of q and w by giving the positive sign to\nthese quantities when these are added to the system. We can measure the transfer of heat from one\nsystem to another which causes the change in temperature. The magnitude of rise in temperature\ndepends on the heat capacity (C) of a substance. Therefore, heat absorbed or evolved is q = C∆T.\nWork can be measured by w = –p ∆V, in case of expansion of gases. Under reversible process, we\nex\ncan put p = pfor infinitesimal changes in the volume making w = – p dV.

Changes of phase such as melting, vaporization and\nsublimation usually occur at constant temperature and can be characterized by enthalpy changes\nwhich are always positive.

For isolated systems,\n∆U = 0. We define another state function, S, entropy for this purpose. entropy is a measure\nof disorder or randomness. For a spontaneous change, total entropy change is positive.\nTherefore, for an isolated system, ∆U = 0, ∆S > 0, so entropy change distinguishes a spontaneous\nchange, while energy change does not.

The presence of reactants in an open beaker is an example of an open system *.

It does not need detailed may be changed will be called adiabatic knowledge of motion of each particle because, process. Adiabatic process is a process in we deal with average measurable properties of which there is no transfer of heat between the system. We specify the state of the system the system and surroundings. Here, the wall by state functions or state variables. Separating the system and the surroundings The state of a thermodynamic system is is called the adiabatic wall(Fig. 5. 3). Described by its measurable or macroscopic(bulk) properties. We can describe the state of a gas by quoting its pressure(p), volume(V), temperature(T), amount(n) etc. Variables like p, V, T are called state variables or state functions because their values depend only on the state of the system and not on how it is reached. In order to completely define the state of a system it is not necessary to define all the properties of the system; as only a certain number of properties can be varied independently. This number depends on the nature of the system. Once these minimum number of macroscopic properties are fixed, Fig. 5. 3 An adiabatic system which does not others automatically have definite values.

Let us consider is same as in the earlier case, say, T T.

No matter how it was done(irrespective of path) produced the same change of state, as measured by the change in the temperature of the system. So, it seems appropriate to define a quantity, the internal energy U, whose value is characteristic of the state of a system, whereby the adiabatic work, w required to ad bring about a change of state is equal to the difference between the value of U in one state and that in another state, U i. e., U = U U = w 2 1 ad Fig. 5. 4 A system which allows heat transfer Therefore, internal energy, U, of the through its boundary.

Some of other familiar state By conventions of IUPAC in chemical functions are V, p, and T. For example, if we thermodynamics. The q is positive, when heat bring a change in temperature of the system is transferred from the surroundings to the from 25 ° C to 35 ° C, the change in temperature system and the internal energy of the system is 35 ° C 25 ° C = + 10 ° C, whether we go straight increases and q is negative when heat is up to 35 ° C or we cool the system for a few transferred from system to the surroundings degrees, then take the system to the final resulting in decrease of the internal energy of temperature. Thus, T is a state function and the change in temperature is independent of the system. * Earlier negative sign was assigned when the work is done on the system and positive sign when the work is done by the system.

The importance of the cycle is that, The enthalpy of solution of AB(s), H, sol the sum of the enthalpy changes round a in water is, therefore, determined by the cycle is zero.

If the lattice enthalpy is very to calculate enthalpy of solution from the high, the dissolution of the compound may expression: not take place at all. Why do many fluorides tend to be less soluble than the corresponding H = H + H sol lattice hyd chlorides? Estimates of the magnitudes of For one mole of Nacl(s), enthalpy changes may be made by using lattice enthalpy = + 788 Kj mol 1 tables of bond energies(enthalpies) and lattice and H = 784 Kj mol 1(from the hyd energies(enthalpies).

This argument can be applied Enthalpy of solution of a substance is the to any solvent with slight modification. Enthalpy change when one mole of it dissolves Enthalpy change for dissolving one mole of in a specified amount of solvent. The enthalpy gaseous hydrogen chloride in 10 mol of water of solution at infinite dilution is the enthalpy can be represented by the following equation. Change observed on dissolving the substance For convenience we will use the symbol aq. In an infinite amount of solvent when the for water interactions between the ions(or solute molecules) are negligible. Hcl(g) + 10 aq. Hcl. 10 aq. When an ionic compound dissolves in a H = 69. 01 Kj / mol solvent, the ions leave their ordered positions Let us consider the following set of on the crystal lattice. These are now more free in enthalpy changes: solution. But solvation of these ions(hydration(S - 1) Hcl(g) + 25 aq. Hcl. 25 aq. In case solvent is water) also occurs at the H = 72. 03 Kj / mol same time. This is shown diagrammatically, for an ionic compound, AB(s)(S - 2) Hcl(g) + 40 aq. Hcl. 40 aq. H = 72. 79 Kj / mol(S - 3) Hcl(g) + aq. Hcl. Aq. H = 74. 85 Kj / mol The values of H show general dependence of the enthalpy of solution on amount of solvent. As more and more solvent is used, the enthalpy of solution approaches a limiting value, i. e, the value in infinitely dilute solution. For hydrochloric acid this value of H is given above in equation(S - 3).

Although the reaction is taking place in the above set of equations, we obtain between them, it is at an extremely slow rate. It is still called spontaneous reaction. Hcl. 25 aq. + 15 aq. Hcl. 40 aq.

However, it does not tell about the This value(0. 76kJ / mol) of H is enthalpy rate of the reaction or process. Another aspect of dilution. It is the heat withdrawn from of spontaneous reaction or process, as we see the surroundings when additional solvent is is that these cannot reverse their direction on added to the solution.

About the relationship between the heat If we examine the phenomenon like flow of absorbed and the work performed on or water down hill or fall of a stone on to the by a system. It puts no restrictions on ground, we find that there is a net decrease the direction of heat flow. However, the in potential energy in the direction of change. Flow of heat is unidirectional from higher By analogy, we may be tempted to state that temperature to lower temperature. In fact, a chemical reaction is spontaneous in a all naturally occurring processes whether given direction, because decrease in energy chemical or physical will tend to proceed has taken place, as in the case of exothermic spontaneously in one direction only. For reactions. For example: example, a gas expanding to fill the available 1 N(g) + H(g) = NH(g); volume, burning carbon in dioxygen giving 2 2 2 3 carbon dioxide. H = 46. 1 Kj mol 1 r But heat will not flow from colder body to 1 1 H(g) + Cl(g) = Hcl(g); warmer body on its own, the gas in a container 2 2 2 2 will not spontaneously contract into one H = 92. 32 Kj mol 1 r corner or carbon dioxide will not form carbon 1 H(g) + O(g) H O(l); and dioxygen spontaneously. These and many 2 2 2 2 H = 285. 8 Kj mol 1 other spontaneously occurring changes show r unidirectional change. We may ask what is The decrease in enthalpy in passing from the driving force of spontaneously occurring reactants to products may be shown for any changes? What determines the direction of a exothermic reaction on an enthalpy diagram spontaneous change? In this section, we shall as shown in Fig. 5. 10(a). Establish some criterion for these processes Thus, the postulate that driving force for whether these will take place or not. A chemical reaction may be due to decrease Let us first understand what do we mean in energy sounds reasonable as the basis of by spontaneous reaction or change? You evidence so far!

When the partition is withdrawn[Fig. 5. 11(b)], the gases begin to diffuse into each other and after a period of time, diffusion will be complete. Let us examine the process. Before partition, if we were to pick up the gas molecules from left container, we would be Fig. 5. 10(b) Enthalpy diagram for endothermic sure that these will be molecules of gas A reactions and similarly if we were to pick up the gas molecules from right container, we would Therefore, it becomes obvious that while be sure that these will be molecules of gas decrease in enthalpy may be a contributory B.

Not sure whether the molecules picked are of(b) Entropy and Spontaneity gas A or gas B. We say that the system has Then, what drives the spontaneous process become less predictable or more chaotic. In a given direction? Let us examine such a We may now formulate another postulate: case in which H = 0 i. e., there is no change in in an isolated system, there is always a enthalpy, but still the process is spontaneous. Tendency for the systems energy to become Let us consider diffusion of two gases more disordered or chaotic and this could be into each other in a closed container which a criterion for spontaneous change!

The greater the disorder in an isolated The total entropy change(S) for the total system, the higher is the entropy. As far as a system and surroundings of a spontaneous chemical reaction is concerned, this entropy process is given by change can be attributed to rearrangement of S S S 0(5. 19) atoms or ions from one pattern in the reactants total system surr to another(in the products). If the structure When a system is in equilibrium, the of the products is very much disordered than entropy is maximum, and the change in that of the reactants, there will be a resultant entropy, S = 0. Increase in entropy. The change in entropy We can say that entropy for a spontaneous accompanying a chemical reaction may be process increases till it reaches maximum estimated qualitatively by a consideration of and at equilibrium the change in entropy is the structures of the species taking part in the zero. Since entropy is a state property, we can reaction. Decrease of regularity in structure calculate the change in entropy of a reversible would mean increase in entropy. For a given process by substance, the crystalline solid state is the state of lowest entropy(most ordered), The q sys, rev gaseous state is state of highest entropy. S sys = T Now let us try to quantify entropy. One way We find that both for reversible and to calculate the degree of disorder or chaotic irreversible expansion for an ideal gas, under distribution of energy among molecules isothermal conditions, U = 0, but S would be through statistical method which i. e., S S is not zero for irreversib to l ta e l sys surr is beyond the scope of this treatment.

For these purposes, we divide the universe into the system and the surroundings. Chemical or physical processes lead to evolution or absorption of heat(q), part of which may be converted into work(w). These quantities are related through the first law of thermodynamics via U = q + w. U, change in internal energy, depends on initial and final states only and is a state function, whereas q and w depend on the path and are not the state functions. We follow sign conventions of q and w by giving the positive sign to these quantities when these are added to the system. We can measure the transfer of heat from one system to another which causes the change in temperature. The magnitude of rise in temperature depends on the heat capacity(C) of a substance. Therefore, heat absorbed or evolved is q = C T. Work can be measured by w = p V, in case of expansion of gases. Under reversible process, we ex can put p = pfor infinitesimal changes in the volume making w = p Dv. In this condition, we ex rev can use gas equation, Pv = Nrt. At constant volume, w = 0, then U = q, heat transfer at constant volume. But in study of V chemical reactions, we usually have constant pressure. We define another state function enthalpy. Enthalpy change, H = U + Nrt, can be found directly from the heat changes at constant pressure, g H = q. P There are varieties of enthalpy changes. Changes of phase such as melting, vaporization and sublimation usually occur at constant temperature and can be characterized by enthalpy changes which are always positive. Enthalpy of formation, combustion and other enthalpy changes can be calculated using Hess s law. Enthalpy change for chemical reactions can be determined by H a H b H r i f products i f reactions f i and in gaseous state by H = bond enthalpies of the reactants bond enthalpies of the products r First law of thermodynamics does not guide us about the direction of chemical reactions i. e., what is the driving force of a chemical reaction. For isolated systems, U = 0. We define another state function, S, entropy for this purpose. Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness. For a spontaneous change, total entropy change is positive. Therefore, for an isolated system, U = 0, S > 0, so entropy change distinguishes a spontaneous change, while energy change does not. Entropy changes can be measured by the equation q q S = rev for a reversible process. Rev is independent of path. T T Chemical reactions are generally carried at constant pressure, so we define another state function gibbs energy, G, which is related to entropy and enthalpy changes of the system by the equation: G = H T S r r r For a spontaneous change, G < 0 and at equilibrium, G = 0. Sys sys Standard Gibbs energy change is related to equilibrium constant by G = RT ln K. R K can be calculated from this equation, if we know G which can be found from r. Temperature is an important factor in the equation.

Equilibrium can be established for both physical and chemical processes and at\nthis stage rate of forward and reverse reactions are equal. Equilibrium constant, K is\nc\nexpressed as the concentration of products divided by reactants, each term raised to the\nstoichiometric coefficient.\nFor reaction, a A + b B c C +d D\nK = [C]c[D]d/[A]a[B]b\nc\nEquilibrium constant has constant value at a fixed temperature and at this stage all the\nmacroscopic properties such as concentration, pressure, etc. become constant. For a gaseous\nreaction equilibrium constant is expressed as K and is written by replacing concentration\np\nterms by partial pressures in K expression. The direction of reaction can be predicted by\nc\nreaction quotient Q which is equal to K at equilibrium. le Chatelier’s principle states that\nc c\nthe change in any factor such as temperature, pressure, concentration, etc. will cause the\nequilibrium to shift in such a direction so as to reduce or counteract the effect of the change.\nIt can be used to study the effect of various factors such as temperature, concentration,\npressure, catalyst and inert gases on the direction of equilibrium and to control the yield of\nproducts by controlling these factors. Catalyst does not effect the equilibrium composition\nof a reaction mixture but increases the rate of chemical reaction by making available a new\nlower energy pathway for conversion of reactants to products and vice-versa.\nAll substances that conduct electricity in aqueous solutions are called electrolytes. Acids,\nbases and salts are electrolytes and the conduction of electricity by their aqueous solutions\nis due to anions and cations produced by the dissociation or ionization of electrolytes\nin aqueous solution. The strong electrolytes are completely dissociated. In weak electrolytes\nthere is equilibrium between the ions and the unionized electrolyte molecules. According to\nArrhenius, acids give hydrogen ions while bases produce hydroxyl ions in their aqueous\nsolutions. brönsted-lowry on the other hand, defined an acid as a proton donor and a base as\na proton acceptor. When a Brönsted-Lowry acid reacts with a base, it produces its conjugate\nbase and a conjugate acid corresponding to the base with which it reacts. Thus a conjugate\npair of acid-base differs only by one proton. lewis further generalised the definition of an\nacid as an electron pair acceptor and a base as an electron pair donor. The expressions\nfor ionization (equilibrium) constants of weak acids (K ) and weak bases (K ) are developed\na b\nusing Arrhenius definition. The degree of ionization and its dependence on concentration and\ncommon ion are discussed. The pH scale (pH = –log[H+]) for the hydrogen ion concentration\n(activity) has been introduced and extended to other quantities (pOH = – log[OH–]); pK = –log[K];\na a\npK = –log[K ]; and pK = –log[K ] etc.). The ionization of water has been considered and we\nb b w w\nnote that the equation: pH + pOH = pK is always satisfied. The salts of strong acid and\nw\nweak base, weak acid and strong base, and weak acid and weak base undergo hydrolysis in\naqueous solution. The definition of buffer solutions, and their importance are discussed\nbriefly. The solubility equilibrium of sparingly soluble salts is discussed and the equilibrium\nconstant is introduced as solubility product constant (K ). Its relationship with solubility\nsp\nof the salt is established. The conditions of precipitation of the salt from their solutions\nor their dissolution in water are worked out. The role of common ion and the solubility of\nsparingly soluble salts is also discussed.\nReprint 2025-26\nUnit 6.indd 207 9/12/2022 11:58:31 AM\n208 chemistry\nSUGGEStED ACtiVitiES FOr StUDEntS rEGArDinG tHiS Unit\n(a) The student may use pH paper in determining the pH of fresh juices of various vegetables\nand fruits, soft drinks, body fluids and also that of water samples available.\n(b) The pH paper may also be used to determine the pH of different salt solutions and from\nthat he/she may determine if these are formed from strong/weak acids and bases.\n(c) They may prepare some buffer solutions by mixing the solutions of sodium acetate and\nacetic acid and determine their pH using pH paper.\n(d) They may be provided with different indicators to observe their colours in solutions of\nvarying pH.\n(e) They may perform some acid-base titrations using indicators.\n(f) They may observe common ion effect on the solubility of sparingly soluble salts.\n(g) If pH meter is available in their school, they may measure the pH with it and compare\nthe results obtained with that of the pH paper.\nEXErCiSES\n6.1 A liquid is in equilibrium with its vapour in a sealed container at a fixed temperature.\nThe volume of the container is suddenly increased.\na) What is the initial effect of the change on vapour pressure?\nb) How do rates of evaporation and condensation change initially?\nc) What happens when equilibrium is restored finally and what will be the final vapour\npressure?\n6.2 What is K for the following equilibrium when the equilibrium concentration of each\nc\nsubstance is: [SO ]= 0.60M, [O ] = 0.82M and [SO ] = 1.90M ?\n2 2 3\n2SO (g) + O (g) 2SO (g)\n2 2 3\n6.3 At a certain temperature and total pressure of 105Pa, iodine vapour contains 40% by\nvolume of I atoms\nI (g) 2I (g)\n2\nCalculate K for the equilibrium.\np\n6.4 Write the expression for the equilibrium constant, K for each of the following reactions:\nc\n(i) 2NOCl (g) 2NO (g) + Cl (g)\n2\n(ii) 2Cu(NO ) (s) 2CuO (s) + 4NO (g) + O (g)\n32 2 2\n(iii) CH COOC H (aq) + H O(l) CH COOH (aq) + C H OH (aq)\n3 2 5 2 3 2 5\n(iv) Fe3+ (aq) + 3OH– (aq) Fe(OH) (s)\n3\n(v) I (s) + 5F 2IF\n2 2 5\n6.5 Find out the value of K for each of the following equilibria from the value of K :\nc p\n(i) 2NOCl (g) 2NO (g) + Cl (g); K = 1.8 × 10–2 at 500 K\n2 p\n(ii) CaCO (s) CaO(s) + CO (g); K = 167 at 1073 K\n3 2 p\nReprint 2025-26\nUnit 6.indd 208 9/12/2022 11:58:31 AM\nEQUILIBRIUM 209\n6.6 For the following equilibrium, K= 6.3 × 1014 at 1000 K\nc\nNO (g) + O (g) NO (g) + O (g)\n3 2 2\nBoth the forward and reverse reactions in the equilibrium are elementary bimolecular\nreactions.

PROCESSES DYNAMIC The dynamic nature of chemical EQUILIBRIUM equilibrium can be demonstrated in the Analogous to the physical systems chemical synthesis of ammonia by Haber s process. Reactions also attain a state of equilibrium. In a series of experiments, Haber started These reactions can occur both in forward with known amounts of dinitrogen and and backward directions. When the rates of dihydrogen maintained at high temperature the forward and reverse reactions become and pressure and at regular intervals equal, the concentrations of the reactants determined the amount of ammonia present. And the products remain constant. This He was successful in determining also the is the stage of chemical equilibrium. This concentration of unreacted dihydrogen and equilibrium is dynamic in nature as it consists dinitrogen. Fig. 6. 4(page 174) shows that after of a forward reaction in which the reactants a certain time the composition of the mixture give product(s) and reverse reaction in which remains the same even though some of the product(s) gives the original reactants. Reactants are still present. This constancy in For a better comprehension, let us consider composition indicates that the reaction has a general case of a reversible reaction, reached equilibrium.

This can be demonstrated by the use of radioactive isotopes. This is not feasible in a school laboratory. However this concept can be easily comprehended by performing the following activity. The activity can be performed in a group of 5 or 6 students. Take two 100mL measuring cylinders(marked as 1 and 2) and two glass tubes each of 30 cm length. Diameter of the tubes may be same or different in the range of 3 - 5mm. Fill nearly half of the measuring cylinder - 1 with coloured water(for this purpose add a crystal of potassium permanganate to water) and keep second cylinder(number 2) empty. Put one tube in cylinder 1 and second in cylinder 2. Immerse one tube in cylinder 1, close its upper tip with a finger and transfer the coloured water contained in its lower portion to cylinder 2. Using second tube, kept in 2nd cylinder, transfer the coloured water in a similar manner from cylinder 2 to cylinder 1. In this way keep on transferring coloured water using the two glass tubes from cylinder 1 to 2 and from 2 to 1 till you notice that the level of coloured water in both the cylinders becomes constant. If you continue intertransferring coloured solution between the cylinders, there will not be any further change in the levels of coloured water in two cylinders. If we take analogy of level of coloured water with concentration of reactants and products in the two cylinders, we can say the process of transfer, which continues even after the constancy of level, is indicative of dynamic nature of the process. If we repeat the experiment taking two tubes of different diameters we find that at equilibrium the level of coloured water in two cylinders is different. How far diameters are responsible for change in levels in two cylinders? Empty cylinder(2) is an indicator of no product in it at the beginning. 1 2 1 2(a)(b) Fig. 6. 3 Demonstrating dynamic nature of equilibrium.(a) initial stage(b) final stage after the equilibrium is attained.

If we start with 2 2 equal initial concentration of H and I, the 2 2 reaction proceeds in the forward direction and the concentration of H and I decreases 2 2 while that of HI increases, until all of these become constant at equilibrium(Fig. 6. 5). We can also start with HI alone and make the reaction to proceed in the reverse direction; the concentration of HI will decrease and concentration of H and I will increase until 2 2 they all become constant when equilibrium is reached(Fig. 6. 5). If total number of H and I atoms are same in a given volume, the same equilibrium mixture is obtained whether we Fig. 6. 4 Depiction of equilibrium for the reaction start it from pure reactants or pure product.

Later, when this mixture is analysed, it is found that the concentration of ammonia is just the same as before. However, when this mixture is analysed by a mass spectrometer, it is found that ammonia and all deuterium containing forms of ammonia(NH, NH D, NHD and 3 2 2 ND) and dihydrogen and its deutrated forms 3(H, HD and D) are present. Thus one can 2 2 conclude that scrambling of H and D atoms in the molecules must result from a continuation of the forward and reverse reactions in the mixture.

The Six sets of experiments with varying initial last question in particular is important when conditions were performed, starting with only choosing conditions for synthesis of industrial gaseous H and I in a sealed reaction vessel 2 2 chemicals such as H, NH, Cao etc. In first four experiments(1, 2, 3 and 4) and 2 3 To answer these questions, let us consider only HI in other two experiments(5 and 6). A general reversible reaction: Experiment 1, 2, 3 and 4 were performed taking different concentrations of H and / or A + B C + D 2 I, and with time it was observed that intensity where A and B are the reactants, C and D 2 of the purple colour remained constant and are the products in the balanced chemical equilibrium was attained. Similarly, for equation. On the basis of experimental studies of many reversible reactions, the Norwegian experiments 5 and 6, the equilibrium was chemists Cato Maximillian Guldberg and attained from the opposite direction. Peter Waage proposed in 1864 that the Data obtained from all six sets of concentrations in an equilibrium mixture experiments are given in Table 6. 2. Are related by the following equilibrium It is evident from the experiments 1, 2, equation, 3 and 4 that number of moles of dihydrogen C D K(6. 1) reacted = number of moles of iodine reacted c A B = 1 2(number of moles of HI formed). Also,(6. 1) where K is the equilibrium constant and experiments 5 and 6 indicate that, c the expression on the right side is called the[H(g)] =[I(g)] equilibrium constant expression. 2 eq 2 eq Knowing the above facts, in order The equilibrium equation is also known as the law of mass action because in the early to establish a relationship between days of chemistry, concentration was called concentrations of the reactants and products, active mass. In order to appreciate their several combinations can be tried. Let us work better, let us consider reaction between consider the simple expression, gaseous H and I carried out in a sealed vessel 2 2[HI(g)] /[H(g)][I(g)] at 731K.

However, if we consider indicated by enclosing these in square bracket the expression, and, as mentioned above, it is implied that these are equilibrium concentrations. While[HI(g)] 2 /[H(g)][I(g)] eq 2 eq 2 eq writing expression for equilibrium constant, we find that this expression gives constant symbol for phases(s, l, g) are generally ignored. Value(as shown in Table 6. 3) in all the six Let us write equilibrium constant for the cases. It can be seen that in this expression the power of the concentration for reactants reaction, H(g) + I(g) 2HI(g)(6. 5) 2 2 and products are actually the stoichiometric as, K =[HI] 2 /[H][I] = x(6. 6) coefficients in the equation for the chemical c 2 2 reaction. Thus, for the reaction H(g) + I(g) The equilibrium constant for the reverse 2 2 2HI(g), following equation 6. 1, the equilibrium reaction, 2HI(g) H(g) + I(g), at the same 2 2 constant K is written as, temperature is, c K =[HI(g)] 2 /[H(g)][I(g)](6. 2) K =[H][I] /[HI] 2 = 1 / x = 1 / K(6. 7) c eq 2 eq 2 eq c 2 2 c Thus, K = 1 / K(6. 8) Generally the subscript eq(used for c c equilibrium) is omitted from the concentration Equilibrium constant for the reverse terms. It is taken for granted that the reaction is the inverse of the equilibrium concentrations in the expression for K are constant for the reaction in the forward c equilibrium values. We, therefore, write, direction.

This implies maximum reactants or products in a reaction at yield of products at mild temperature and equilibrium is changed, the composition pressure conditions. If it does not happen, of the equilibrium mixture changes so as then the experimental conditions need to be to minimize the effect of concentration adjusted. For example, in the Haber process changes. For the synthesis of ammonia from N and 2 Let us take the reaction, H, the choice of experimental conditions is 2 H(g) + I(g) 2HI(g) of real economic importance. Annual world 2 2 production of ammonia is about hundred If H is added to the reaction mixture 2 million tones, primarily for use as fertilisers. At equilibrium, then the equilibrium of the reaction is disturbed. In order to restore it, Equilibrium constant, K is independent c the reaction proceeds in a direction wherein of initial concentrations. But if a system at H is consumed, i. e., more of H and I react equilibrium is subjected to a change in the 2 2 2 to form HI and finally the equilibrium shifts concentration of one or more of the reacting in right(forward) direction(Fig. 6. 8). This is in substances, then the system is no longer at accordance with the Le Chatelier s principle equilibrium; and net reaction takes place in which implies that in case of addition of a some direction until the system returns to reactant / product, a new equilibrium will equilibrium once again. Similarly, a change be set up in which the concentration of the in temperature or pressure of the system may reactant / product should be less than what it also alter the equilibrium. In order to decide was after the addition but more than what it what course the reaction adopts and make was in the original mixture. A qualitative prediction about the effect of a change in conditions on equilibrium we use Le Chatelier s principle. It states that a change in any of the factors that determine the equilibrium conditions of a system will cause the system to change in such a manner so as to reduce or to counteract the effect of the change. This is applicable to all physical and chemical equilibria. We shall now be discussing factors which can influence the equilibrium. 6. 8. 1 Effect of Concentration Change In general, when equilibrium is disturbed by the addition / removal of any reactant / products, Le Chatelier s principle predicts that: The concentration stress of an added reactant / product is relieved by net Fig. 6. 8 Effect of addition of H on change reaction in the direction that consumes 2 of concentration for the reactants the added substance. And products in the reaction, The concentration stress of a removed H(g) + I2(g) 2HI(g) 2 reactant / product is relieved by net reaction in the direction that replenishes The same point can be explained in terms the removed substance.

Similarly, 2 colour because Hg2 + reacts with SCN ions to we can say that removal of a product also form stable complex ion[Hg(SCN)] 2. Removal boosts the forward reaction and increases 4 of free SCN(aq) shifts the equilibrium the concentration of the products and this in equation(6. 24) from right to left to has great commercial application in cases replenish SCN ions. Addition of potassium of reactions, where the product is a gas or a thiocyanate on the other hand increases the volatile substance. In case of manufacture of colour intensity of the solution as it shift the ammonia, ammonia is liquified and removed equilibrium to right. From the reaction mixture so that reaction keeps moving in forward direction.

Of pressure changes on solids and liquids can be ignored because the volume(and Effect of Concentration An experiment concentration) of a solution / liquid is nearly This can be demonstrated by the following independent of pressure.

This equilibrium can be longer at equilibrium. The direction in which shifted in either forward or reverse directions the reaction goes to re - establish equilibrium depending on our choice of adding a reactant can be predicted by applying the Le Chatelier s or a product. The equilibrium can be shifted principle. Since pressure has doubled, in the opposite direction by adding reagents the equilibrium now shifts in the forward that remove Fe3 + or SCN ions. For example, direction, a direction in which the number oxalic acid(H C O), reacts with Fe3 + ions of moles of the gas or pressure decreases(we 2 2 4 to form the stable complex ion[Fe(C O)] 3, know pressure is proportional to moles of the 2 4 3 thus decreasing the concentration of free gas).

Faraday further classified equilibrium, whereas high temperatures give electrolytes into strong and weak electrolytes. Satisfactory rates but poor yields. Strong electrolytes on dissolution in water German chemist, Fritz Haber discovered are ionized almost completely, while the weak that a catalyst consisting of iron catalyse electrolytes are only partially dissociated.

At the age of 14 he was an apprentice to a kind bookbinder who allowed Faraday to read the books he was binding. Through a fortunate chance he became laboratory assistant to Davy, and during 1813 - 4, Faraday accompanied him to the Continent. During this trip he gained much from the experience of coming into contact with many of the leading scientists of the time. In 1825, he succeeded Davy as Director of the Royal Institution laboratories, and in 1833 he also became the first Fullerian Professor of Chemistry. Faraday s first important work was on analytical chemistry. After 1821 Michael Faraday much of his work was on electricity and magnetism and different electromagnetic(1791 1867) phenomena. His ideas have led to the establishment of modern field theory. He discovered his two laws of electrolysis in 1834. Faraday was a very modest and kind hearted person. He declined all honours and avoided scientific controversies. He preferred to work alone and never had any assistant. He disseminated science in a variety of ways including his Friday evening discourses, which he founded at the Royal Institution. He has been very famous for his Christmas lecture on the Chemical History of a Candle. He published nearly 450 scientific papers.

The extent to which Hydrogen ion by itself is a bare proton with very ionization occurs depends upon the strength small size(~ 10 15 m radius) and intense electric of the bond and the extent of solvation field, binds itself with the water molecule at of ions produced. The terms dissociation one of the two available lone pairs on it giving and ionization have earlier been used with H O +. This species has been detected in many 3 different meaning.

Similarly, a base molecule like MOH ionizes in aqueous solution according to the equation: MOH(aq) M +(aq) + OH(aq) The hydroxyl ion also exists in the hydrated form in the aqueous solution.

He presented his thesis, on the conductivities of electrolyte solutions, to the University of Uppsala in 1884. For the next five years he travelled extensively and visited a number of research centers in Europe. In 1895 he was appointed professor of physics at the newly formed University of Stockholm, serving its rector from 1897 to 1902. From 1905 until his death he was Director of physical chemistry at the Nobel Institute in Stockholm. He continued to work for many years on electrolytic solutions. In 1899 he discussed the temperature dependence of reaction rates on the basis of an equation, now usually known as Arrhenius equation. He worked in a variety of fields, and made important contributions to Svante Arrhenius immunochemistry, cosmology, the origin of life, and the causes of ice age. He was(1859 - 1927) the first to discuss the green house effect calling by that name. He received Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1903 for his theory of electrolytic dissociation and its use in the development of chemistry. Base, respectively.

Equilibrium can be established for both physical and chemical processes and at this stage rate of forward and reverse reactions are equal. Equilibrium constant, K is c expressed as the concentration of products divided by reactants, each term raised to the stoichiometric coefficient. For reaction, a A + b B c C + d D K =[C] c[D] d /[A] a[B] b c Equilibrium constant has constant value at a fixed temperature and at this stage all the macroscopic properties such as concentration, pressure, etc. Become constant. For a gaseous reaction equilibrium constant is expressed as K and is written by replacing concentration p terms by partial pressures in K expression. The direction of reaction can be predicted by c reaction quotient Q which is equal to K at equilibrium. Le Chatelier s principle states that c c the change in any factor such as temperature, pressure, concentration, etc. Will cause the equilibrium to shift in such a direction so as to reduce or counteract the effect of the change. It can be used to study the effect of various factors such as temperature, concentration, pressure, catalyst and inert gases on the direction of equilibrium and to control the yield of products by controlling these factors. Catalyst does not effect the equilibrium composition of a reaction mixture but increases the rate of chemical reaction by making available a new lower energy pathway for conversion of reactants to products and vice - versa. All substances that conduct electricity in aqueous solutions are called electrolytes. Acids, bases and salts are electrolytes and the conduction of electricity by their aqueous solutions is due to anions and cations produced by the dissociation or ionization of electrolytes in aqueous solution. The strong electrolytes are completely dissociated. In weak electrolytes there is equilibrium between the ions and the unionized electrolyte molecules. According to Arrhenius, acids give hydrogen ions while bases produce hydroxyl ions in their aqueous solutions. Brönsted - lowry on the other hand, defined an acid as a proton donor and a base as a proton acceptor. When a Brönsted - Lowry acid reacts with a base, it produces its conjugate base and a conjugate acid corresponding to the base with which it reacts. Thus a conjugate pair of acid - base differs only by one proton. Lewis further generalised the definition of an acid as an electron pair acceptor and a base as an electron pair donor. The expressions for ionization(equilibrium) constants of weak acids(K) and weak bases(K) are developed a b using Arrhenius definition. The degree of ionization and its dependence on concentration and common ion are discussed. The Ph scale(Ph = log[H +]) for the hydrogen ion concentration(activity) has been introduced and extended to other quantities(Poh = log[OH]); Pk = log[K]; a a Pk = log[K]; and Pk = log[K] etc.). The ionization of water has been considered and we b b w w note that the equation: Ph + Poh = Pk is always satisfied. The salts of strong acid and w weak base, weak acid and strong base, and weak acid and weak base undergo hydrolysis in aqueous solution. The definition of buffer solutions, and their importance are discussed briefly. The solubility equilibrium of sparingly soluble salts is discussed and the equilibrium constant is introduced as solubility product constant(K). Its relationship with solubility sp of the salt is established. The conditions of precipitation of the salt from their solutions or their dissolution in water are worked out. The role of common ion and the solubility of sparingly soluble salts is also discussed.

In\nThe Paradox of Fractional Oxidation Number\nSometimes, we come across with certain compounds in which the oxidation number of a particular\nelement in the compound is in fraction. Examples are:\nC O [where oxidation number of carbon is (4/3)],\n3 2\nBr O [where oxidation number of bromine is (16/3)]\n3 8\nand Na S O (where oxidation number of sulphur is 2.5).\n2 4 6\nWe know that the idea of fractional oxidation number is unconvincing to us, because electrons\nare never shared/transferred in fraction. Actually this fractional oxidation state is the average\noxidation state of the element under examination and the structural parameters reveal that the\nelement for whom fractional oxidation state is realised is present in different oxidation states.\nStructure of the species C O , Br O and S O2– reveal the following bonding situations:\n3 2 3 8 4 6\n+2 0 +2\nO = C = C*= C = O\nStructure of C O\n3 2\n(carbon suboxide)\nStructure of Br O (tribromooctaoxide) Structure of S O2– (tetrathionate ion)\n3 8 4 6\nThe element marked with asterisk in each species is exhibiting the different oxidation\nstate (oxidation number) from rest of the atoms of the same element in each of the species.\nThis reveals that in C O , two carbon atoms are present in +2 oxidation state each, whereas\n3 2\nthe third one is present in zero oxidation state and the average is 4/3. However, the realistic\npicture is +2 for two terminal carbons and zero for the middle carbon. Likewise in Br O , each\n3 8\nof the two terminal bromine atoms are present in +6 oxidation state and the middle bromine\nis present in +4 oxidation state. Once again the average, that is different from reality, is\n16/3. In the same fashion, in the species S O2–, each of the two extreme sulphurs exhibits oxidation\n4 6\nstate of +5 and the two middle sulphurs as zero. The average of four oxidation numbers of sulphurs\nof the S O 2– is 2.5, whereas the reality being + 5,0,0 and +5 oxidation number respectively for\n4 6\neach sulphur.\nWe may thus, in general, conclude that the idea of fractional oxidation state should be taken\nwith care and the reality is revealed by the structures only. Further, whenever we come across\nwith fractional oxidation state of any particular element in any species, we must understand that\nthis is the average oxidation number only. In reality (revealed by structures only), the element in\nthat particular species is present in more than one whole number oxidation states. Fe O , Mn O ,\n3 4 3 4\nPb O are some of the other examples of the compounds, which are mixed oxides, where we come\n3 4\nacross with fractional oxidation states of the metal atom. However, the oxidation states may be in\nfraction as in O+ and O– where it is +½ and –½ respectively.\n2 2\nReprint 2025-26\nUnit 7.indd 245 10/10/2022 10:37:04 AM\n246 chemistry\n(a) Oxidation Number Method: In writing\nProblem 7.7\nequations for oxidation-reduction reactions,\nWhy do the following reactions proceed just as for other reactions, the compositions and\ndifferently ? formulas must be known for the substances\nthat react and for the products that are\nPb O + 8HCl → 3PbCl + Cl + 4H O and\n3 4 2 2 2 formed.

Three tier conceptualisation viz, classical, electronic and oxidation\nnumber, which is usually available in the texts, has been presented in detail. Oxidation,\nreduction, oxidising agent (oxidant) and reducing agent (reductant) have been viewed\naccording to each conceptualisation. Oxidation numbers are assigned in accordance with a\nconsistent set of rules. Oxidation number and ion-electron method both are useful means in\nwriting equations for the redox reactions. Redox reactions are classified into four categories:\ncombination, decomposition displacement and disproportionation reactions. The concept of\nredox couple and electrode processes is introduced here. The redox reactions find wide\napplications in the study of electrode processes and cells.\nEXERCISES\n7.1 Assign oxidation number to the underlined elements in each of the following species:\n(a) NaH PO (b) NaHSO (c) H P O (d) K MnO\n2 4 4 4 2 7 2 4\n(e) CaO (f) NaBH (g) H S O (h) KAl(SO ) .12 H O\n2 4 2 2 7 42 2\n7.2 What are the oxidation number of the underlined elements in each of the following\nand how do you rationalise your results ?\n(a) KI (b) H S O (c) Fe O (d) CH CH OH (e) CH COOH\n3 2 4 6 3 4 3 2 3\n7.3 Justify that the following reactions are redox reactions:\n(a) CuO(s) + H (g) → Cu(s) + H O(g)\n2 2\n(b) Fe O (s) + 3CO(g) → 2Fe(s) + 3CO (g)\n2 3 2\n(c) 4BCl (g) + 3LiAlH (s) → 2B H (g) + 3LiCl(s) + 3 AlCl (s)\n3 4 2 6 3\n(d) 2K(s) + F (g) → 2K+F– (s)\n2\n(e) 4 NH (g) + 5 O (g) → 4NO(g) + 6H O(g)\n3 2 2\n7.4 Fluorine reacts with ice and results in the change:\nH O(s) + F (g) → HF(g) + HOF(g)\n2 2\nJustify that this reaction is a redox reaction.\n7.5 Calculate the oxidation number of sulphur, chromium and nitrogen in H SO , Cr O2–\n2 5 2 7\nand NO–.

Suggest a comparative order 7. 1 CLASSICAL IDEA OF REDOX REACTIONS among various reductants and OXIDATION AND REDUCTION REACTIONS oxidants; Originally, the term oxidation was used to describe the balance chemical equations using(i) oxidation number addition of oxygen to an element or a compound. Because(ii) half reaction method; of the presence of dioxygen in the atmosphere(~ 20 %), learn the concept of redox many elements combine with it and this is the principal reactions in terms of electrode reason why they commonly occur on the earth in the processes. Form of their oxides. The following reactions represent oxidation processes according to the limited definition of oxidation: 2 Mg(s) + O(g) 2 Mgo(s)(7. 1) 2 S(s) + O(g) SO(g)(7. 2) 2 2 Reprint 2025 - 26 Unit 7. indd 235 10 / 10 / 2022 10: 37: 02 AM 236 chemistry In reactions(7. 1) and(7. 2), the elements broadened these days to include removal magnesium and sulphur are oxidised on of oxygen / electronegative element from account of addition of oxygen to them. A substance or addition of hydrogen / Similarly, methane is oxidised owing to the electropositive element to a substance. Addition of oxygen to it. According to the definition given above, CH(g) + 2O(g) CO(g) + 2H O(l)(7. 3) the following are the examples of reduction 4 2 2 2 processes: A careful examination of reaction(7. 3) in which hydrogen has been replaced by oxygen 2 Hgo(s) 2 Hg(l) + O(g)(7. 8) 2 prompted chemists to reinterpret oxidation(removal of oxygen from mercuric oxide) in terms of removal of hydrogen from it and, 2 Fecl(aq) + H(g) 2 Fecl(aq) + 2 Hcl(aq) therefore, the scope of term oxidation was 3 2 2(7. 9) broadened to include the removal of hydrogen(removal of electronegative element, chlorine from a substance. The following illustration is from ferric chloride) another reaction where removal of hydrogen can also be cited as an oxidation reaction. CH = CH(g) + H(g) H C CH(g)(7. 10) 2 2 2 3 3(addition of hydrogen) 2 H S(g) + O(g) 2 S(s) + 2 H O(l)(7. 4) 2 2 2 2HgCl(aq) + Sncl(aq) Hg Cl(s) + Sncl(aq) As knowledge of chemists grew, it was 2 2 2 2 4 natural to extend the term oxidation for(7. 11) reactions similar to(7. 1 to 7. 4), which do(addition of mercury to mercuric chloride) not involve oxygen but other electronegative In reaction(7. 11) simultaneous oxidation elements. The oxidation of magnesium with of stannous chloride to stannic chloride is fluorine, chlorine and sulphur etc. Occurs also occurring because of the addition of according to the following reactions: electronegative element chlorine to it. It was soon realised that oxidation and reduction Mg(s) + F(g) Mgf(s)(7. 5) 2 2 always occur simultaneously(as will be apparent by re - examining all the equations Mg(s) + Cl(g) Mgcl(s)(7. 6) 2 2 given above), hence, the word redox was Mg(s) + S(s) Mgs(s)(7. 7) coined for this class of chemical reactions. Incorporating the reactions(7. 5 to Problem 7. 1 7. 7) within the fold of oxidation reactions In the reactions given below, identify encouraged chemists to consider not only the species undergoing oxidation and the removal of hydrogen as oxidation, but reduction: also the removal of electropositive elements(i) H S(g) + Cl(g) 2 Hcl(g) + S(s) as oxidation. Thus the reaction: 2 2(ii) 3Fe O(s) + 8 Al(s) 9 Fe(s) 2K[Fe(CN)](aq) + H O(aq) 2K[Fe(CN)](aq) 3 4 4 6 2 2 3 6 + 2 KOH(aq) + 4Al O(s) 2 3 is interpreted as oxidation due to the removal(i) 2 Na(s) + H(g) 2 Nah(s) 2 of electropositive element potassium from Solution potassium ferrocyanide before it changes to(i) H S is oxidised because a more potassium ferricyanide. To summarise, the 2 electronegative element, chlorine is added term oxidation is defined as the addition to hydrogen(or a more electropositive of oxygen / electronegative element to element, hydrogen has been removed a substance or removal of hydrogen / from S). Chlorine is reduced due to electropositive element from a substance. Addition of hydrogen to it.

Steps, one involving the loss of electrons(i) With the careful application of the and the other the gain of electrons. As an concept of electronegativity only we illustration, we may further elaborate one of may infer that sodium is oxidised and these, say, the formation of sodium chloride. Hydrogen is reduced. 2 Na(s) 2 Na +(g) + 2e Reaction(i) chosen here prompts us to think in terms of another way to define Cl(g) + 2e 2 Cl(g) 2 redox reactions. Each of the above steps is called a half reaction, which explicitly shows involvement 7. 2 REDOX REACTIONS IN TERMS OF of electrons. Sum of the half reactions gives ELECTRON TRANSFER REACTIONS the overall reaction: We have already learnt that the reactions 2 Na(s) + Cl(g) 2 Na + Cl(s) or 2 Nacl(s) 2Na(s) + Cl(g) 2NaCl(s)(7. 12) 2 2 Reactions 7. 12 to 7. 14 suggest that half 4Na(s) + O(g) 2Na O(s)(7. 13) 2 2 reactions that involve loss of electrons are 2Na(s) + S(s) Na S(s)(7. 14) called oxidation reactions. Similarly, the 2 are redox reactions because in each of these half reactions that involve gain of electrons reactions sodium is oxidised due to the addition are called reduction reactions. It may not of either oxygen or more electronegative be out of context to mention here that the element to sodium. Simultaneously, chlorine, new way of defining oxidation and reduction oxygen and sulphur are reduced because to has been achieved only by establishing a each of these, the electropositive element correlation between the behaviour of species sodium has been added. From our knowledge as per the classical idea and their interplay of chemical bonding we also know that sodium in electron - transfer change. In reactions(7. 12 chloride, sodium oxide and sodium sulphide to 7. 14) sodium, which is oxidised, acts as are ionic compounds and perhaps better a reducing agent because it donates electron written as Na + Cl(s),(Na +) O2(s), and(Na +) to each of the elements interacting with it and 2 2 S2(s). Development of charges on the species thus helps in reducing them. Chlorine, oxygen produced suggests us to rewrite the reactions and sulphur are reduced and act as oxidising(7. 12 to 7. 14) in the following manner: agents because these accept electrons from sodium. To summarise, we may mention that Oxidation: Loss of electron(s) by any species. Reduction: Gain of electron(s) by any species. Oxidising agent: Acceptor of electron(s). Reducing agent: Donor of electron(s). Problem 7. 2 Justify that the reaction: 2 Na(s) + H(g) 2 Nah(s) is a redox 2 change. Solution Since in the above reaction the compound formed is an ionic compound, which may also be represented as Na + H(s), this suggests that one half reaction in this process is: 2 Na(s) 2 Na +(g) + 2e Reprint 2025 - 26 Unit 7. indd 237 10 / 10 / 2022 10: 37: 03 AM 238 chemistry and the other half reaction is: At this stage we may investigate the state of equilibrium for the reaction represented by H(g) + 2e 2 H(g) 2 equation(7. 15). For this purpose, let us place This splitting of the reaction under a strip of metallic copper in a zinc sulphate examination into two half reactions solution. No visible reaction is noticed and automatically reveals that here sodium attempt to detect the presence of Cu2 + ions is oxidised and hydrogen is reduced, by passing H S gas through the solution to therefore, the complete reaction is a 2 produce the black colour of cupric sulphide, redox change. Cus, does not succeed. Cupric sulphide has such a low solubility that this is an extremely 7. 2. 1 Competitive Electron Transfer sensitive test; yet the amount of Cu2 + formed Reactions cannot be detected. We thus conclude that Place a strip of metallic zinc in an aqueous the state of equilibrium for the reaction(7. 15) solution of copper nitrate as shown in Fig. Greatly favours the products over the reactants. 7. 1, for about one hour. You may notice Let us extend electron transfer reaction that the strip becomes coated with reddish now to copper metal and silver nitrate solution metallic copper and the blue colour of the in water and arrange a set - up as shown in solution disappears. Formation of Zn2 + ions Fig. 7. 2. The solution develops blue colour among the products can easily be judged due to the formation of Cu2 + ions on account when the blue colour of the solution due to of the reaction: Cu2 + has disappeared. If hydrogen sulphide gas is passed through the colourless solution containing Zn2 + ions, appearance of white zinc sulphide, Zns can be seen on making the solution alkaline with ammonia. The reaction between metallic zinc and the(7. 16) aqueous solution of copper nitrate is: Here, Cu(s) is oxidised to Cu2 +(aq) and Zn(s) + Cu2 +(aq) Zn2 +(aq) + Cu(s)(7. 15) Ag +(aq) is reduced to Ag(s).

By way of contrast, let us also compare Evidently, now if zinc is oxidised, releasing the reaction of metallic cobalt placed in nickel electrons, something must be reduced, sulphate solution. The reaction that occurs accepting the electrons lost by zinc. Copper here is: ion is reduced by gaining electrons from the zinc.

What has been said here with respect This competition for release of electrons to equation(7. 18) may be true for a good incidently reminds us of the competition for number of other reactions involving covalent release of protons among acids. The similarity compounds. Two such examples of this class suggests that we might develop a table in of the reactions are: which metals and their ions are listed on the H(s) + Cl(g) 2HCl(g)(7. 19) 2 2 basis of their tendency to release electrons and, just as we do in the case of acids to indicate CH(g) + 4Cl(g) Ccl(l) + 4HCl(g)(7. 20) the strength of the acids. As a matter of fact 4 2 4 In order to keep track of electron shifts we have already made certain comparisons. In chemical reactions involving formation By comparison we have come to know that of covalent compounds, a more practical zinc releases electrons to copper and copper method of using oxidation number has releases electrons to silver and, therefore, been developed. In this method, it is always the electron releasing tendency of the metals assumed that there is a complete transfer is in the order: Zn > Cu > Ag. We would love to of electron from a less electronegative atom make our list more vast and design a metal to a more electonegative atom. For example, activity series or electrochemical series. We rewrite equations(7. 18 to 7. 20) to show The competition for electrons between various charge on each of the atoms forming part of metals helps us to design a class of cells, the reaction: named as Galvanic cells in which the chemical reactions become the source of electrical 0 0 + 1 2 energy.

Chlorine, bromine and atom of that element will then be the average iodine when combined with oxygen, for of the oxidation number of all the atoms of example in oxoacids and oxoanions, have that element. We may at this stage, state the positive oxidation numbers. Rules for the calculation of oxidation number. 6. The algebraic sum of the oxidation number These rules are: of all the atoms in a compound must be 1. In elements, in the free or the uncombined zero. In polyatomic ion, the algebraic sum state, each atom bears an oxidation of all the oxidation numbers of atoms of number of zero. Evidently each atom in the ion must equal the charge on the ion. H, O, Cl, O, P, S, Na, Mg, Al has the 2 2 2 3 4 8 Thus, the sum of oxidation number of three oxidation number zero. Oxygen atoms and one carbon atom in the 2. For ions composed of only one atom, the carbonate ion,(CO) 2 must equal 2. Oxidation number is equal to the charge 3 By the application of above rules, we can on the ion. Thus Na + ion has an oxidation find out the oxidation number of the desired number of + 1, Mg2 + ion, + 2, Fe3 + ion, + 3, element in a molecule or in an ion. It is clear Cl ion, 1, O2 ion, 2; and so on. In their that the metallic elements have positive compounds all alkali metals have oxidation oxidation number and nonmetallic elements number of + 1, and all alkaline earth metals have positive or negative oxidation number.

Highest oxidation number of a representative 3. The oxidation number of oxygen in most element is the group number for the first compounds is 2. However, we come two groups and the group number minus 10 across two kinds of exceptions here.(following the long form of periodic table) for One arises in the case of peroxides and the other groups. Thus, it implies that the superoxides, the compounds of oxygen in highest value of oxidation number exhibited which oxygen atoms are directly linked to by an atom of an element generally increases each other. While in peroxides(e. g., H O, across the period in the periodic table. In the 2 2 Na O), each oxygen atom is assigned an third period, the highest value of oxidation 2 2 oxidation number of 1, in superoxides number changes from 1 to 7 as indicated(e. g., KO, Rbo) each oxygen atom is below in the compounds of the elements. 2 2 assigned an oxidation number of(1 2). A term that is often used interchangeably The second exception appears rarely, i. e. With the oxidation number is the oxidation when oxygen is bonded to fluorine. In state. Thus in CO, the oxidation state of 2 such compounds e. g., oxygen difluoride carbon is + 4, that is also its oxidation number(OF) and dioxygen difluoride(O F), the and similarly the oxidation state as well 2 2 2 oxygen is assigned an oxidation number as oxidation number of oxygen is 2. This of + 2 and + 1, respectively. The number implies that the oxidation number denotes the assigned to oxygen will depend upon the oxidation state of an element in a compound.

On the other hand, chlorine(7. 35) can displace bromide and iodide ions in an 0 + 1 2 + 3 2 0 aqueous solution as shown below: 2Fe(s) + 3H O(l) Fe O(s) + 3H(g)(7. 36) 2 2 3 2 0 + 1 1 + 1 1 0 Many metals, including those which do not Cl(g) + 2KBr(aq) 2 Kcl(aq) + Br(l) 2 2 react with cold water, are capable of displacing(7. 41) hydrogen from acids. Dihydrogen from acids 0 + 1 1 + 1 1 0 may even be produced by such metals which Cl(g) + 2KI(aq) 2 Kcl(aq) + I(s) 2 2 do not react with steam. Cadmium and tin are(7. 42) the examples of such metals.

In The Paradox of Fractional Oxidation Number Sometimes, we come across with certain compounds in which the oxidation number of a particular element in the compound is in fraction. Examples are: C O[where oxidation number of carbon is(4 / 3)], 3 2 Br O[where oxidation number of bromine is(16 / 3)] 3 8 and Na S O(where oxidation number of sulphur is 2. 5). 2 4 6 We know that the idea of fractional oxidation number is unconvincing to us, because electrons are never shared / transferred in fraction. Actually this fractional oxidation state is the average oxidation state of the element under examination and the structural parameters reveal that the element for whom fractional oxidation state is realised is present in different oxidation states. Structure of the species C O, Br O and S O2 reveal the following bonding situations: 3 2 3 8 4 6 + 2 0 + 2 O = C = C * = C = O Structure of C O 3 2(carbon suboxide) Structure of Br O(tribromooctaoxide) Structure of S O2(tetrathionate ion) 3 8 4 6 The element marked with asterisk in each species is exhibiting the different oxidation state(oxidation number) from rest of the atoms of the same element in each of the species. This reveals that in C O, two carbon atoms are present in + 2 oxidation state each, whereas 3 2 the third one is present in zero oxidation state and the average is 4 / 3. However, the realistic picture is + 2 for two terminal carbons and zero for the middle carbon. Likewise in Br O, each 3 8 of the two terminal bromine atoms are present in + 6 oxidation state and the middle bromine is present in + 4 oxidation state. Once again the average, that is different from reality, is 16 / 3. In the same fashion, in the species S O2, each of the two extreme sulphurs exhibits oxidation 4 6 state of + 5 and the two middle sulphurs as zero. The average of four oxidation numbers of sulphurs of the S O 2 is 2. 5, whereas the reality being + 5, 0, 0 and + 5 oxidation number respectively for 4 6 each sulphur. We may thus, in general, conclude that the idea of fractional oxidation state should be taken with care and the reality is revealed by the structures only. Further, whenever we come across with fractional oxidation state of any particular element in any species, we must understand that this is the average oxidation number only. In reality(revealed by structures only), the element in that particular species is present in more than one whole number oxidation states. Fe O, Mn O, 3 4 3 4 Pb O are some of the other examples of the compounds, which are mixed oxides, where we come 3 4 across with fractional oxidation states of the metal atom. However, the oxidation states may be in fraction as in O + and O where it is + 1 2 and 1 2 respectively. 2 2 Reprint 2025 - 26 Unit 7. indd 245 10 / 10 / 2022 10: 37: 04 AM 246 chemistry(a) Oxidation Number Method: In writing Problem 7. 7 equations for oxidation - reduction reactions, Why do the following reactions proceed just as for other reactions, the compositions and differently?

The electricity from solution in one beaker to solution in the other beaker flows by the migration of ions through the salt bridge. We know that the flow of current is possible only if there is a potential difference between the copper and zinc rods known as electrodes here. The potential associated with each electrode is known as electrode potential. If the concentration of each species taking part in the electrode reaction is unity(if any gas appears in the electrode reaction, it is confined to 1 atmospheric pressure) and further the reaction is carried out at 298K, then the potential of each electrode is said Fig. 7. 3 The set - up for Daniell cell.

Three tier conceptualisation viz, classical, electronic and oxidation number, which is usually available in the texts, has been presented in detail. Oxidation, reduction, oxidising agent(oxidant) and reducing agent(reductant) have been viewed according to each conceptualisation. Oxidation numbers are assigned in accordance with a consistent set of rules. Oxidation number and ion - electron method both are useful means in writing equations for the redox reactions. Redox reactions are classified into four categories: combination, decomposition displacement and disproportionation reactions. The concept of redox couple and electrode processes is introduced here. The redox reactions find wide applications in the study of electrode processes and cells.

It is based on the difference in\nthe solubilities of the compound and the\nimpurities in a suitable solvent.

The nature of the covalent bonding\nin organic compounds can be described in terms of orbitals hybridisation concept,\naccording to which carbon can have sp3, sp2 and sp hybridised orbitals. The sp3, sp2 and sp\nhybridised carbons are found in compounds like methane, ethene and ethyne respectively.\nThe tetrahedral shape of methane, planar shape of ethene and linear shape of ethyne can\nbe understood on the basis of this concept. A sp3 hybrid orbital can overlap with 1s orbital\nof hydrogen to give a carbon - hydrogen (C–H) single bond (sigma, σ bond). Overlap of a sp2\norbital of one carbon with sp2 orbital of another results in the formation of a carbon–carbon\nσ bond. The unhybridised p orbitals on two adjacent carbons can undergo lateral (side-\nby-side) overlap to give a pi (π) bond. Organic compounds can be represented by various\nstructural formulas. The three dimensional representation of organic compounds on paper\ncan be drawn by wedge and dash formula.\nOrganic compounds can be classified on the basis of their structure or the functional\ngroups they contain. A functional group is an atom or group of atoms bonded together in a\nunique fashion and which determines the physical and chemical properties of the compounds.\nThe naming of the organic compounds is carried out by following a set of rules laid down by\nthe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (iuPac). In IUPAC nomenclature,\nthe names are correlated with the structure in such a way that the reader can deduce the\nstructure from the name.\nOrganic reaction mechanism concepts are based on the structure of the substrate\nmolecule, fission of a covalent bond, the attacking reagents, the electron displacement effects\nand the conditions of the reaction. These organic reactions involve breaking and making\nof covalent bonds. A covalent bond may be cleaved in heterolytic or homolytic fashion.\nA heterolytic cleavage yields carbocations or carbanions, while a homolytic cleavage gives\nfree radicals as reactive intermediate. Reactions proceeding through heterolytic cleavage\ninvolve the complimentary pairs of reactive species. These are electron pair donor known as\nnucleophile and an electron pair acceptor known as electrophile. The inductive, resonance,\nelectromeric and hyperconjugation effects may help in the polarisation of a bond making\ncertain carbon atom or other atom positions as places of low or high electron densities.\nOrganic reactions can be broadly classified into following types; substitution, addition,\nelimination and rearrangement reactions.\nPurification, qualitative and quantitative analysis of organic compounds are carried out\nfor determining their structures. The methods of purification namely : sublimation, distillation\nand differential extraction are based on the difference in one or more physical properties.\nChromatography is a useful technique of separation, identification and purification of\ncompounds. It is classified into two categories : adsorption and partition chromatography.\nAdsorption chromatography is based on differential adsorption of various components of a\nmixture on an adsorbent. Partition chromatography involves continuous partitioning of the\ncomponents of a mixture between stationary and mobile phases. After getting the compound\nin a pure form, its qualitative analysis is carried out for detection of elements present in it.\nNitrogen, sulphur, halogens and phosphorus are detected by lassaigne’s test. Carbon and\nhydrogen are estimated by determining the amounts of carbon dioxide and water produced.\nNitrogen is estimated by dumas or Kjeldahl’s method and halogens by Carius method.\nSulphur and phosphorus are estimated by oxidising them to sulphuric and phosphoric acids\nrespectively. The percentage of oxygen is usually determined by difference between the total\npercentage (100) and the sum of percentages of all other elements present.\nReprint 2025-26\nUnit 8.indd 291 10/10/2022 10:37:39 AM\n292 chemistry\nExERCISES\n8.1 What are hybridisation states of each carbon atom in the following compounds ?\nCH =C=O, CH CH=CH , (CH ) CO, CH =CHCN, C H\n2 3 2 32 2 6 6\n8.2 Indicate the σ and π bonds in the following molecules :\nC H , C H , CH Cl , CH =C=CH , CH NO , HCONHCH\n6 6 6 12 2 2 2 2 3 2 3\n8.3 Write bond line formulas for : Isopropyl alcohol, 2,3-Dimethylbutanal, Heptan-4-one.\n8.4 Give the IUPAC names of the following compounds :\n(a) (b) (c)\n(d) (e) (f) Cl CHCH OH\n2 2\n8.5 Which of the following represents the correct IUPAC name for the compounds\nconcerned ?

In the framework model only the bonds connecting the atoms of a molecule and not the atoms themselves are shown. This model emphasizes the pattern of bonds of a molecule while ignoring the size of atoms. In the ball - and - stick model, both the atoms and the bonds are shown.

The members of a homologous series can be represented by general molecular formula and the successive members differ from each other in molecular formula by a CH unit. There are a number 2 of homologous series of organic compounds. Some of these are alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, haloalkanes, alkanols, alkanals, alkanones, alkanoic acids, amines etc. It is also possible that a compound contains two or more identical or different functional groups. This gives rise to polyfunctional compounds. 8. 5 Nomenclature of Organic Compounds Organic chemistry deals with millions of 8. 5. 1 the Iupac system of nomenclature compounds. In order to clearly identify A systematic name of an organic compound them, a systematic method of naming has is generally derived by identifying the parent been developed and is known as the Iupac hydrocarbon and the functional group(s)(international union of pure and applied attached to it. See the example given below. Chemistry) system of nomenclature. In this systematic nomenclature, the names are correlated with the structure such that the reader or listener can deduce the structure from the name. Before the IUPAC system of nomenclature, however, organic compounds were assigned names based on their origin or certain properties. For instance, citric acid is named Reprint 2025 - 26 Unit 8. indd 262 11 / 10 / 2022 15: 20: 58 organic chemistry some basic principles and techniques 263 By further using prefixes and suffixes, the In order to name such compounds, the names parent name can be modified to obtain the of alkyl groups are prefixed to the name of actual name. Compounds containing carbon parent alkane. An alkyl group is derived and hydrogen only are called hydrocarbons. From a saturated hydrocarbon by removing A hydrocarbon is termed saturated if it a hydrogen atom from carbon. Thus, CH 4 contains only carbon - carbon single bonds. Becomes - CH and is called methyl group. An 3 The IUPAC name for a homologous series of alkyl group is named by substituting yl for such compounds is alkane. Paraffin(Latin: ane in the corresponding alkane. Some alkyl little affinity) was the earlier name given to groups are listed in Table 8. 3. These compounds. Unsaturated hydrocarbons table 8. 3 some alkyl groups are those, which contain at least one carbon - carbon double or triple bond. 8. 5. 2 Iupac nomenclature of alkanes Straight chain hydrocarbons: The names of such compounds are based on their chain structure, and end with suffix - ane and carry a prefix indicating the number of carbon atoms present in the chain(except from CH 4 to C H, where the prefixes are derived from 4 10 trivial names). The IUPAC names of some straight chain saturated hydrocarbons are Abbreviations are used for some alkyl given in Table 8. 2. The alkanes in Table groups. For example, methyl is abbreviated as 8. 2 differ from each other by merely the Me, ethyl as Et, propyl as Pr and butyl as Bu. Number of - CH groups in the chain.

First of all, the longest carbon chain in separated from the groups by hyphens the molecule is identified. In the example and there is no break between methyl(I) given below, the longest chain has nine and nonane.] carbons and it is considered as the parent 4. If two or more identical substituent or root chain. Selection of parent chain as groups are present then the numbers shown in(II) is not correct because it has are separated by commas. The names of only eight carbons. Identical substituents are not repeated, instead prefixes such as di(for 2), tri(for 3), tetra(for 4), penta(for 5), hexa(for 6) etc. Are used. While writing the name of the substituents in alphabetical order, these prefixes, however, are not considered. Thus, the following compounds are named as: CH CH CH CH 3 3 3 3 CH - CH - CH - CH - CH CH C CH CH CH 3 2 3 3 2 3 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 2, 4 - Dimethylpentane 2, 2, 4 - Trimethylpentane 2.

The numbering is CH 3 done in such a way that the branched 3 - Ethyl - 4, 4 - dimethylheptane carbon atoms get the lowest possible numbers. Thus, the numbering in the 5. If the two substituents are found in above example should be from left to right equivalent positions, the lower number(branching at carbon atoms 2 and 6) and is given to the one coming first in the not from right to left(giving numbers alphabetical listing.

Different classes. Examples of some functional groups with their prefixes and suffixes along Problem 8. 8 with some examples of organic compounds Write the IUPAC names of the compounds possessing these are given in Table 8. 4. I - iv from their given structures. First of all, the functional group present in the molecule is identified which determines the choice of appropriate suffix. The longest chain of carbon atoms containing the functional group is numbered in such a way solution that the functional group is attached at the carbon atom possessing lowest possible The functional group present is an number in the chain. By using the suffix as alcohol(OH). Hence the suffix is - ol. Given in Table 8. 4, the name of the compound The longest chain containing - OH is arrived at. Has eight carbon atoms. Hence the In the case of polyfunctional compounds, corresponding saturated hydrocar - one of the functional groups is chosen as the bon is octane. Principal functional group and the compound The - OH is on carbon atom 3. In is then named on that basis. The remaining addition, a methyl group is attached functional groups, which are subordinate at 6th carbon. Functional groups, are named as substituents Hence, the systematic name of this using the appropriate prefixes. The choice of compound is 6 - Methyloctan - 3 - ol. Principal functional group is made on the basis of order of preference. The order of decreasing priority for some functional groups is: - Cooh, So h, - Coor(r = alkyl group), Cocl, 3 - CONH, - cn, - hc = O, > c = O, - Oh, - nh, > 2 2 c = c <, - c C -. Solution The R, C H -, halogens(F, Cl, Br, I), NO, The functional group present is ketone 6 5 2 alkoxy(OR) etc. Are always prefix(> C = O), hence suffix - one. Presence substituents. Thus, a compound containing of two keto groups is indicated by di, both an alcohol and a keto group is named hence suffix becomes dione. The two as hydroxyalkanone since the keto group is keto groups are at carbons 2 and 4. Preferred to the hydroxyl group. The longest chain contains 6 carbon For example, HOCH(CH) CH COCH will atoms, hence, parent hydrocarbon is 2 2 3 2 3 be named as 7 - hydroxyheptan - 2 - one and not hexane. Thus, the systematic name is as 2 - oxoheptan - 7 - ol. Similarly, BrCH CH = CH Hexane - 2, 4 - dione. 2 2 is named as 3 - bromoprop - 1 - ene and not 1 - bromoprop - 2 - ene. If more than one functional group of the same type are present, their number is indicated by adding di, tri, etc. Before the Reprint 2025 - 26 Unit 8. indd 266 10 / 10 / 2022 10: 37: 32 AM organic chemistry some basic principles and techniques 267 table 8. 4 some Functional groups and classes of Organic compounds Reprint 2025 - 26 Unit 8. indd 267 10 / 10 / 2022 10: 37: 32 AM 268 chemistry solution(i) Six membered ring containing a carbon - carbon double bond is implied Here, two functional groups namely by cyclohexene, which is numbered as ketone and carboxylic acid are present.

The longest 2 chain including the principal functional group has 6 carbon atoms; hence the parent hydrocarbon is hexane. The compound is, therefore, named as 5 - Oxohexanoic acid.(iv) 1 - ol means that a - OH group is solution present at C - 1. OH is suffixed functional The two C = C functional groups are group and gets preference over C = C present at carbon atoms 1 and 3, while bond. Thus the structure is as shown the C C functional group is present at in(II): carbon 5. These groups are indicated by suffixes diene and yne respectively. The longest chain containing the functional groups has 6 carbon atoms; hence the parent hydrocarbon is hexane.

Nitrobenzene Bromobenzene 1 - Chloro - 2, 4 - dinitrobenzene(not 4 - chloro, 1, 3 - dinitrobenzene) If benzene ring is disubstituted, the position of substituents is defined by numbering the carbon atoms of the ring such that the substituents are located at the lowest numbers possible. For example, the compound(b) is named as 1, 3 - dibromobenzene and not as 1, 5 - dibromobenzene. 2 - Chloro - 1 - methyl - 4 - nitrobenzene(not 4 - methyl - 5 - chloro - nitrobenzene)(a)(b)(c) 1, 2 - Dibromo - 1, 3 - Dibromo - 1, 4 - Dibromo - benzene benzene benzene In the trivial system of nomenclature 2 - Chloro - 4 - methylanisole 4 - Ethyl - 2 - methylaniline the terms ortho(o), meta(m) and para(p) are used as prefixes to indicate the relative positions 1, 2; 1, 3 and 1, 4 respectively. Thus, 1, 3 - dibromobenzene(b) is named as m - dibromobenzene(meta is abbreviated as m -) and the other isomers of dibromobenzene 1, 2 -(a) and 1, 4 -(c), are named as ortho(or just o -) and para(or just p -) - dibromobenzene, respectively. For tri - or higher substituted benzene 3, 4 - Dimethylphenol derivatives, these prefixes cannot be used and the compounds are named by identifying When a benzene ring is attached to an substituent positions on the ring by following alkane with a functional group, it is considered the lowest locant rule.

ORGANIC REACTION MECHANISM In an organic reaction, the organic molecule A species having a carbon atom possessing(also referred as a substrate) reacts with an sextext of electrons and a positive charge is appropriate attacking reagent and leads to the formation of one or more intermediate(s) called a carbocation(earlier called carbonium and finally product(s) ion). The H ion is known as a methyl cation 3 or methyl carbonium ion. Carbocations are The general reaction is depicted as follows: classified as primary, secondary or tertiary Attacking depending on whether one, two or three Organic Reagent[Intermediate] Product(s) carbons are directly attached to the positively molecule charged carbon. Some other examples of Byproducts +(Substrate) carbocations are: CH CH(ethyl cation, a 3 2 + primary carbocation),(CH) CH(isopropyl 3 2 + Substrate is that reactant which supplies cation, a secondary carbocation), and(CH) C 3 3 carbon to the new bond and the other reactant(tert - butyl cation, a tertiary carbocation). Is called reagent. If both the reactants Carbocations are highly unstable and supply carbon to the new bond then choice reactive species. Alkyl groups directly is arbitrary and in that case the molecule on attached to the positively charged carbon which attention is focused is called substrate. Stabilise the carbocations due to inductive In such a reaction a covalent bond and hyperconjugation effects, which you will between two carbon atoms or a carbon and be studying in the sections 8. 7. 5 and 8. 7. 9.

The remaining the formation of neutral species(atom or carbon orbital is perpendicular to the group) which contains an unpaired electron. Molecular plane and contains no electrons. These species are called free radicals. Like[Fig. 8. 3(a)]. Carbocations and carbanions, free radicals are also very reactive. A homolytic cleavage can be shown as: Alkyl free radical Alkyl radicals are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary.

Carbon in carbanion is generally of organic compounds. Molecules as such sp3 hybridised and its structure is distorted participate in the reaction. It is convenient to tetrahedron as shown in Fig. 8. 3(b). Name one reagent as substrate and other as reagent. In general, a molecule whose carbon is involved in new bond formation is called substrate and the other one is called reagent. When carbon - carbon bond is formed, the choice of naming the reactants as substrate and reagent is arbitrary and depends on molecule under observation. Example: Fig. 8. 3(b) Shape of methyl carbanion(i) CH = CH + Br CH Br CH Br 2 2 2 2 2 Substrate Reagent Product Carbanions are also unstable and reactive species. The organic reactions which proceed through heterolytic bond cleavage are called(ii) ionic or heteropolar or just polar reactions.

Various methods used for the purification of organic compounds are based on the nature of the compound and the impurity present in it. The common techniques used for purification are as follows:(i) Sublimation(ii) Crystallisation(i) Distillation(iv) Differential extraction and(v) Chromatography Finally, the purity of a compound is ascertained by determining its melting or boiling point. Most of the pure compounds have sharp melting points and boiling points. The hyperconjugation may also be New methods of checking the purity of an regarded as no bond resonance.

You have learnt earlier that on heating, some The vapours of higher boiling component solid substances change from solid to vapour form later and the liquid can be collected state without passing through liquid state. Separately. The purification technique based on the above principle is known as sublimation and is used to separate sublimable compounds from non - sublimable impurities. 8. 8. 2 crystallisation This is one of the most commonly used techniques for the purification of solid organic compounds. It is based on the difference in the solubilities of the compound and the impurities in a suitable solvent. The impure compound is dissolved in a solvent in which it is sparingly soluble at room temperature but appreciably soluble at higher temperature. The solution is concentrated to get a nearly saturated solution. On cooling the solution, pure compound crystallises out and is removed by filtration. The filtrate(mother liquor) contains impurities and small quantity of the compound. If the compound is highly soluble in one solvent and very little soluble in another solvent, crystallisation can be Fig. 8. 5 Simple distillation. The vapours of a substance formed are condensed and satisfactorily carried out in a mixture of these the liquid is collected in conical flask. Solvents. Impurities, which impart colour to the solution are removed by adsorbing over Fractional Distillation: If the difference activated charcoal. Repeated crystallisation in boiling points of two liquids is not much, becomes necessary for the purification of compounds containing impurities of simple distillation cannot be used to separate comparable solubilities. Them. The vapours of such liquids are formed within the same temperature range and are 8. 8. 3 distillation condensed simultaneously. The technique of This important method is used to separate fractional distillation is used in such cases. In(i) volatile liquids from nonvolatile impurities this technique, vapours of a liquid mixture are and(ii) the liquids having sufficient difference passed through a fractionating column before in their boiling points. Liquids having condensation. The fractionating column is different boiling points vaporise at different fitted over the mouth of the round bottom temperatures. The vapours are cooled and flask(Fig. 8. 6, page 280). The liquids so formed are collected separately. Vapours of the liquid with higher boiling Chloroform(b. p 334 K) and aniline(b. p. 457 point condense before the vapours of the K) are easily separated by the technique of liquid with lower boiling point. The vapours distillation(Fig 8. 5). The liquid mixture is rising up in the fractionating column become taken in a round bottom flask and heated richer in more volatile component. By the Reprint 2025 - 26 Unit 8. indd 279 10 / 10 / 2022 10: 37: 35 AM 280 chemistry unit in the fractionating column is called a theoretical plate. Commercially, columns with hundreds of plates are available. One of the technological applications of fractional distillation is to separate different fractions of crude oil in petroleum industry. Distillation under reduced pressure: This method is used to purify liquids having very high boiling points and those, which decompose at or below their boiling points. Such liquids are made to boil at a temperature lower than their normal boiling points by reducing the pressure on their surface. A liquid boils at a temperature at which its vapour pressure is equal to the external pressure. The pressure is reduced with the help of a water pump or vacuum pump(Fig. 8. 8). Glycerol can be separated from Fig. 8. 6 Fractional distillation. The vapours of lower boiling spent - lye in soap industry by fraction reach the top of the column first followed by using this technique. Vapours of higher boiling fractions. Time the vapours reach to the top of the fractionating column, these are rich in the more volatile component. Fractionating columns are available in various sizes and designs as shown in Fig. 8. 7. A fractionating column provides many surfaces for heat exchange between the ascending vapours and the descending condensed liquid. Some of the condensing liquid in the fractionating column obtains heat from the ascending vapours and revaporises. The vapours thus become richer in low boiling component. The vapours of low boiling component ascend to the top of the column. On reaching the top, the vapours become pure in low boiling component and pass through the condenser and the pure liquid is collected in a receiver. After a series of successive distillations, the remaining liquid in the distillation flask gets enriched in high boiling component. Each Fig. 8. 7 Different types of fractionating columns.

Steam volatile component volatilizes, the vapours condense in the condenser and the liquid collects in conical flask. Name chromatography is based on the Greek word chroma, for colour since the method was first used for the separation of coloured substances found in plants. In this technique, the mixture of substances is applied onto a stationary phase, which may be a solid or a liquid. A pure solvent, a mixture of solvents, or a gas is allowed to move slowly over the stationary phase. The components of the mixture get gradually separated from one another. The moving phase is called the mobile phase. Based on the principle involved, chromatography is classified into different categories. Two of these are:(a) Adsorption chromatography, and Fig. 8. 10 Differential extraction. Extraction of com -(b) Partition chromatography.

Reprint 2025 - 26 Unit 8. indd 290 10 / 10 / 2022 10: 37: 39 AM organic chemistry some basic principles and techniques 291 summary In this unit, we have learnt some basic concepts in structure and reactivity of organic compounds, which are formed due to covalent bonding. The nature of the covalent bonding in organic compounds can be described in terms of orbitals hybridisation concept, according to which carbon can have sp3, sp2 and sp hybridised orbitals. The sp3, sp2 and sp hybridised carbons are found in compounds like methane, ethene and ethyne respectively. The tetrahedral shape of methane, planar shape of ethene and linear shape of ethyne can be understood on the basis of this concept. A sp3 hybrid orbital can overlap with 1s orbital of hydrogen to give a carbon - hydrogen(C H) single bond(sigma, bond). Overlap of a sp2 orbital of one carbon with sp2 orbital of another results in the formation of a carbon carbon bond. The unhybridised p orbitals on two adjacent carbons can undergo lateral(side - by - side) overlap to give a pi() bond. Organic compounds can be represented by various structural formulas. The three dimensional representation of organic compounds on paper can be drawn by wedge and dash formula. Organic compounds can be classified on the basis of their structure or the functional groups they contain. A functional group is an atom or group of atoms bonded together in a unique fashion and which determines the physical and chemical properties of the compounds. The naming of the organic compounds is carried out by following a set of rules laid down by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry(Iupac). In IUPAC nomenclature, the names are correlated with the structure in such a way that the reader can deduce the structure from the name. Organic reaction mechanism concepts are based on the structure of the substrate molecule, fission of a covalent bond, the attacking reagents, the electron displacement effects and the conditions of the reaction. These organic reactions involve breaking and making of covalent bonds. A covalent bond may be cleaved in heterolytic or homolytic fashion. A heterolytic cleavage yields carbocations or carbanions, while a homolytic cleavage gives free radicals as reactive intermediate. Reactions proceeding through heterolytic cleavage involve the complimentary pairs of reactive species. These are electron pair donor known as nucleophile and an electron pair acceptor known as electrophile. The inductive, resonance, electromeric and hyperconjugation effects may help in the polarisation of a bond making certain carbon atom or other atom positions as places of low or high electron densities. Organic reactions can be broadly classified into following types; substitution, addition, elimination and rearrangement reactions. Purification, qualitative and quantitative analysis of organic compounds are carried out for determining their structures. The methods of purification namely: sublimation, distillation and differential extraction are based on the difference in one or more physical properties. Chromatography is a useful technique of separation, identification and purification of compounds. It is classified into two categories: adsorption and partition chromatography. Adsorption chromatography is based on differential adsorption of various components of a mixture on an adsorbent. Partition chromatography involves continuous partitioning of the components of a mixture between stationary and mobile phases. After getting the compound in a pure form, its qualitative analysis is carried out for detection of elements present in it. Nitrogen, sulphur, halogens and phosphorus are detected by lassaigne s test. Carbon and hydrogen are estimated by determining the amounts of carbon dioxide and water produced. Nitrogen is estimated by dumas or Kjeldahl s method and halogens by Carius method. Sulphur and phosphorus are estimated by oxidising them to sulphuric and phosphoric acids respectively. The percentage of oxygen is usually determined by difference between the total percentage(100) and the sum of percentages of all other elements present.

Markovnikov, a Russian chemist made a\ngeneralisation in 1869 after studying such\nreactions in detail. These generalisations\nled Markovnikov to frame a rule called\nMarkovnikov rule. The rule states that\nnegative part of the addendum (adding\n(9.38) molecule) gets attached to that carbon atom\nwhich possesses lesser number of hydrogen\natoms. Thus according to this rule, product\nI i.e., 2-bromopropane is expected. In actual\npractice, this is the principal product of the\nreaction. This generalisation of Markovnikov\n(9.39) rule can be better understood in terms of\nmechanism of the reaction.\n3.

He became Professor in 1856 and Fellow of Royal Society in 1875. He\nmade major contribution to structural organic chemistry by proposing in 1858 that\ncarbon atoms can join to one another to form chains and later in 1865,he found\nan answer to the challenging problem of benzene structure by suggesting that\nthese chains can close to form rings. He gave the dynamic structural formula to\nbenzene which forms the basis for its modern electronic structure. He described\nthe discovery of benzene structure later as:\nFRIEDRICH\n“I was sitting writing at my textbook,but the work did not progress; my thoughts\nAUGUST KEKULÉ\nwere elsewhere.

But look! What\nwas that? One of the snakes had seized hold of it’s own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my\neyes. As if by a flash of lightning I woke;.... I spent the rest of the night working out the consequences of\nthe hypothesis. Let us learn to dream, gentlemen, and then perhaps we shall learn the truth but let us\nbeware of making our dreams public before they have been approved by the waking mind.”( 1890).\nOne hundred years later, on the occasion of Kekulé’s centenary celebrations a group of compounds\nhaving polybenzenoid structures have been named as Kekulenes.\nwas further found to produce one and only one\nmonosubstituted derivative which indicated\nthat all the six carbon and six hydrogen atoms\nof benzene are identical.

The hybrid\nstructure is represented by inserting a circle\nor a dotted circle in the hexagon as shown\nin (C).

Hydrocarbons are mainly\nobtained from coal and petroleum, which are the major sources of energy. Petrochemicals\nare the prominent starting materials used for the manufacture of a large number of\ncommercially important products. LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) and CNG (compressed\nnatural gas), the main sources of energy for domestic fuels and the automobile industry, are\nobtained from petroleum. Hydrocarbons are classified as open chain saturated (alkanes)\nand unsaturated (alkenes and alkynes), cyclic (alicyclic) and aromatic, according to their\nstructure.\nThe important reactions of alkanes are free radical substitution, combustion, oxidation\nand aromatization. Alkenes and alkynes undergo addition reactions, which are mainly\nelectrophilic additions. Aromatic hydrocarbons, despite having unsaturation, undergo\nmainly electrophilic substitution reactions. These undergo addition reactions only under\nspecial conditions.\nAlkanes show conformational isomerism due to free rotation along the C–C sigma\nbonds. Out of staggered and the eclipsed conformations of ethane, staggered conformation\nis more stable as hydrogen atoms are farthest apart. Alkenes exhibit geometrical\n(cis-trans) isomerism due to restricted rotation around the carbon–carbon double bond.\nbenzene and benzenoid compounds show aromatic character. Aromaticity, the\nproperty of being aromatic is possessed by compounds having specific electronic structure\ncharacterised by Hückel (4n+2)π electron rule. The nature of groups or substituents attached\nto benzene ring is responsible for activation or deactivation of the benzene ring towards\nfurther electrophilic substitution and also for orientation of the incoming group.

You can construct a large number of models of such molecules of both types(open chain and close chain) keeping in mind that carbon is tetravalent and hydrogen is monovalent. For making models of alkanes, you can use toothpicks for bonds and plasticine balls for atoms.

Conformations by rotation around C - C single bonds. However, it may be remembered that rotation around a C - C single bond is not completely free. It is hindered by a small 1 energy barrier of 1 - 20 Kj mol due to weak repulsive interaction between the adjacent bonds. Such a type of repulsive interaction is called torsional strain.

Any other intermediate conformation is called a skew conformation. It may be remembered that in all the conformations, the bond angles and the bond lengths remain the same. Eclipsed and the staggered conformations can be represented by sawhorse and newman projections. Fig. 9. 3 Newman s projections of ethane Reprint 2025 - 26 Unit 9. indd 305 10 / 10 / 2022 10: 37: 54 AM 306 chemistry Relative stability of conformations: As the first member, ethylene or ethene(C H) 2 4 mentioned earlier, in staggered form of ethane, was found to form an oily liquid on reaction the electron clouds of carbon - hydrogen bonds with chlorine. Are as far apart as possible. Thus, there are 9. 3. 1 structure of Double Bond minimum repulsive forces, minimum energy Carbon - carbon double bond in alkenes and maximum stability of the molecule. On the consists of one strong sigma() bond(bond other hand, when the staggered form changes 1 enthalpy about 397 Kj mol) due to head - on into the eclipsed form, the electron clouds of the overlapping of sp2 hybridised orbitals and carbon hydrogen bonds come closer to each one weak pi() bond(bond enthalpy about other resulting in increase in electron cloud 1 284 Kj mol) obtained by lateral or sideways repulsions. To check the increased repulsive overlapping of the two 2p orbitals of the two forces, molecule will have to possess more carbon atoms. The double bond is shorter in energy and thus has lesser stability. As already bond length(134 pm) than the C C single mentioned, the repulsive interaction between bond(154 pm). You have already read that the electron clouds, which affects stability of the pi() bond is a weaker bond due to poor a conformation, is called torsional strain. Sideways overlapping between the two 2p Magnitude of torsional strain depends upon orbitals. Thus, the presence of the pi() bond the angle of rotation about C C bond. This makes alkenes behave as sources of loosely angle is also called dihedral angle or torsional held mobile electrons. Therefore, alkenes are angle. Of all the conformations of ethane, the easily attacked by reagents or compounds staggered form has the least torsional strain which are in search of electrons. Such and the eclipsed form, the maximum torsional reagents are called electrophilic reagents. Strain. Therefore, staggered conformation is The presence of weaker - bond makes alkenes more stable than the eclipsed conformation. Unstable molecules in comparison to alkanes Hence, molecule largely remains in staggered and thus, alkenes can be changed into single conformation or we can say that it is preferred bond compounds by combining with the conformation. Thus it may be inferred that electrophilic reagents. Strength of the double rotation around C C bond in ethane is not bond(bond enthalpy, 681 Kj mol 1) is greater completely free. The energy difference between than that of a carbon - carbon single bond in the two extreme forms is of the order of 12. 5 1 ethane(bond enthalpy, 348 Kj mol). Orbital 1 Kj mol, which is very small. Even at ordinary diagrams of ethene molecule are shown in temperatures, the ethane molecule gains Figs. 9. 4 and 9. 5. Thermal or kinetic energy sufficient enough to 1 overcome this energy barrier of 12. 5 Kj mol through intermolecular collisions.

This Pent - 1 - ene illustrates that the restricted rotation of atoms(b) CH CH = CH CH CH or groups around the doubly bonded carbon 3 2 3 Pent - 2 - ene atoms gives rise to different geometries of such compounds. The stereoisomers of this(c) CH C = CH CH 3 3 type are called geometrical isomers. The | isomer of the type(a), in which two identical CH 3 atoms or groups lie on the same side of the 2 - Methylbut - 2 - ene double bond is called cis isomer and the(d) CH CH CH = CH other isomer of the type(b), in which identical 3 2 | atoms or groups lie on the opposite sides of CH the double bond is called trans isomer. Thus 3 3 - Methylbut - 1 - ene cis and trans isomers have the same structure but have different configuration(arrangement(e) CH = C CH CH 2 2 3 of atoms or groups in space).

This reaction is - carbon atom. Known as dehydrohalogenation i. e., removal of halogen acid. This is example of - elimination reaction, since hydrogen atom is eliminated from the carbon atom(carbon atom next to the carbon to which halogen is attached).(9. 37) 9. 3. 5 Properties Physical properties Alkenes as a class resemble alkanes in physical properties, except in types of isomerism and difference in polar nature.(9. 34) The first three members are gases, the next fourteen are liquids and the higher ones are Nature of halogen atom and the alkyl group solids.

The reddish orange colour of bromine solution in carbon tetrachloride is discharged when bromine adds up to an unsaturation site. This reaction is used as a test for unsaturation. Addition of halogens to alkenes is an example of electrophilic addition reaction involving cyclic halonium ion formation(9. 42) which you will study in higher classes. Markovnikov, a Russian chemist made a generalisation in 1869 after studying such reactions in detail. These generalisations led Markovnikov to frame a rule called Markovnikov rule. The rule states that negative part of the addendum(adding(9. 38) molecule) gets attached to that carbon atom which possesses lesser number of hydrogen atoms. Thus according to this rule, product I i. e., 2 - bromopropane is expected. In actual practice, this is the principal product of the reaction. This generalisation of Markovnikov(9. 39) rule can be better understood in terms of mechanism of the reaction. 3. Addition of hydrogen halides: Hydrogen halides(Hcl, Hbr, HI) add up to alkenes Mechanism to form alkyl halides. The order of Hydrogen bromide provides an electrophile, + reactivity of the hydrogen halides is H, which attacks the double bond to form HI > Hbr > Hcl. Like addition of halogens carbocation as shown below: to alkenes, addition of hydrogen halides is also an example of electrophilic addition reaction. Let us illustrate this by taking addition of Hbr to symmetrical and unsymmetrical alkenes Addition reaction of Hbr to symmetrical alkenes(a) less stable(b) more stable Addition reactions of Hbr to symmetrical primary carbocation secondary carbocation alkenes(similar groups attached to double bond) take place by electrophilic addition(i) The secondary carbocation(b) is more mechanism.

This reaction is highly useful in detecting the position of the double(9. 45) bond in alkenes or other unsaturated compounds. 5. Addition of water: In the presence of a few drops of concentrated sulphuric acid alkenes react with water to form alcohols, in accordance with the Markovnikov rule.(9. 51)(9. 46) 6.

He made major contribution to structural organic chemistry by proposing in 1858 that carbon atoms can join to one another to form chains and later in 1865, he found an answer to the challenging problem of benzene structure by suggesting that these chains can close to form rings. He gave the dynamic structural formula to benzene which forms the basis for its modern electronic structure. He described the discovery of benzene structure later as: FRIEDRICH I was sitting writing at my textbook, but the work did not progress; my thoughts AUGUST KEKULÉ were elsewhere. I turned my chair to the fire, and dozed. Again the atoms were(7th September gambolling before my eyes. This time the smaller groups kept modestly in the 1829 13th July background. My mental eye, rendered more acute by repeated visions of this 1896) kind, could now distinguish larger structures of manifold conformations; long rows, sometimes more closely fitted together; all twisting and turning in snake like motion. But look! What was that? One of the snakes had seized hold of it s own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my eyes. As if by a flash of lightning I woke;. I spent the rest of the night working out the consequences of the hypothesis. Let us learn to dream, gentlemen, and then perhaps we shall learn the truth but let us beware of making our dreams public before they have been approved by the waking mind.(1890). One hundred years later, on the occasion of Kekulé s centenary celebrations a group of compounds having polybenzenoid structures have been named as Kekulenes. Was further found to produce one and only one monosubstituted derivative which indicated that all the six carbon and six hydrogen atoms of benzene are identical. On the basis of this observation August Kekulé in 1865 proposed the following structure for benzene having cyclic arrangement of six carbon atoms with 1, 3 Dimethylbenzene 1, 4 - Dimethylbenzene alternate single and double bonds and one(m - Xylene)(p - Xylene) hydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom. 9. 5. 2 structure of benzene Benzene was isolated by Michael Faraday in 1825. The molecular formula of benzene, C H, indicates a high degree of unsaturation. 6 6 This molecular formula did not account for its relationship to corresponding alkanes, alkenes and alkynes which you have studied in earlier sections of this unit. What do you The Kekulé structure indicates think about its possible structure? Due to the possibility of two isomeric its unique properties and unusual stability, 1, 2 - dibromobenzenes.

This problem was overcome by Kekulé by suggesting the concept of oscillating nature of double bonds in benzene as given below. The unhybridised p orbital of carbon atoms are close enough to form a bond by lateral overlap. There are two equal possibilities of Even with this modification, Kekulé forming three bonds by overlap of p orbitals structure of benzene fails to explain unusual of C C, C C, C C or C C, C C, stability and preference to substitution 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 3 4 5 C C respectively as shown in the following reactions than addition reactions, which 6 1 figures. Could later on be explained by resonance. Resonance and stability of benzene According to Valence Bond Theory, the concept of oscillating double bonds in benzene is now explained by resonance. Benzene is a hybrid of various resonating structures. The two structures, A and B given by Kekulé are the main contributing structures. The hybrid structure is represented by inserting a circle or a dotted circle in the hexagon as shown in(C). The circle represents the six electrons which are delocalised between the six carbon Fig. 9. 7(a) atoms of the benzene ring.(A)(B)(C) The orbital overlapping gives us better picture about the structure of benzene. All the six carbon atoms in benzene are sp2 hybridized. Two sp2 hybrid orbitals of each carbon atom overlap with sp2 hybrid orbitals of adjacent carbon atoms to form six C C sigma bonds which are in the hexagonal plane. The remaining sp2 hybrid orbital of Fig. 9. 7(b) each carbon atom overlaps with s orbital Structures shown in Fig. 9. 7(a) and(b) of a hydrogen atom to form six C H sigma correspond to two Kekulé s structure with bonds. Each carbon atom is now left with one localised bonds.

The delocalised electron cloud is attracted more strongly by the nuclei of the carbon atoms than the electron cloud localised between two carbon atoms. Therefore, presence of delocalised electrons in benzene makes it more stable than the hypothetical cyclohexatriene. X - Ray diffraction data reveals that benzene is a planar molecule.

Equal amounts. Two types of behaviour are observed. Either ortho and para products or meta product is predominantly formed. It has also been observed that this behaviour depends on the nature of the substituent already present in the benzene ring and not on the nature of the entering group. This is known as directive influence of substituents. Reasons for ortho / para or meta directive nature of groups are discussed below: Addition reactions Ortho and para directing groups: The Under vigorous conditions, i. e., at high groups which direct the incoming group to temperature and / or pressure in the presence ortho and para positions are called ortho and of nickel catalyst, hydrogenation of benzene para directing groups. As an example, let us gives cyclohexane. Discuss the directive influence of phenolic(OH) group. Phenol is resonance hybrid of following structures: Cyclohexane(9. 80) Under ultra - violet light, three chlorine molecules add to benzene to produce benzene hexachloride, C H Cl which is also called 6 6 6 gammaxane. Benzene hexachloride, It is clear from the above resonating(BHC) structures that the electron density is more on(9. 81) o and p positions. Hence, the substitution Combustion: When heated in air, benzene takes place mainly at these positions. However, burns with sooty flame producing CO and it may be noted that I effect of OH group also 2 H O operates due to which the electron density on 2 15 ortho and para positions of the benzene ring C H + O 6CO + 3H O 6 2 2 2 is slightly reduced. But the overall electron 6 2(9. 82) density increases at these positions of the General combustion reaction for any ring due to resonance. Therefore, OH group hydrocarbon may be given by the following activates the benzene ring for the attack by Reprint 2025 - 26 Unit 9. indd 324 10 / 10 / 2022 10: 38: 01 AM Hydrocarbons 325 an electrophile. Other examples of activating In this case, the overall electron density groups are NH, NHR, NHCOCH, OCH, on benzene ring decreases making further 2 3 3 CH, C H, etc. Substitution difficult, therefore these groups 3 2 5 are also called deactivating groups. The In the case of aryl halides, halogens are moderately deactivating. Because of their electron density on o and p position strong I effect, overall electron density on is comparatively less than that at meta benzene ring decreases. It makes further position. Hence, the electrophile attacks on substitution difficult. However, due to comparatively electron rich meta position resonance the electron density on o and resulting in meta substitution. P positions is greater than that at the 9. 6 Carcinogenicity and toxicity m - position. Hence, they are also o and p directing groups. Resonance structures of Benzene and polynuclear hydrocarbons chlorobenzene are given below: containing more than two benzene rings fused together are toxic and said to possess cancer producing(carcinogenic) property. Such polynuclear hydrocarbons are formed on incomplete combustion of organic materials like tobacco, coal and petroleum. They enter into human body and undergo various biochemical reactions and finally damage DNA and cause cancer. Some of the carcinogenic hydrocarbons are given below(see box). Meta directing group: The groups which direct the incoming group to meta position are called meta directing groups. Some examples of meta directing groups are NO, CN, CHO, 2 COR, COOH, COOR, SO H, etc. 3 Let us take the example of nitro group. Nitro group reduces the electron density in the benzene ring due to its strong I effect. Nitrobenzene is a resonance hybrid of the following structures.

Hydrocarbons are mainly obtained from coal and petroleum, which are the major sources of energy. Petrochemicals are the prominent starting materials used for the manufacture of a large number of commercially important products. LPG(liquefied petroleum gas) and CNG(compressed natural gas), the main sources of energy for domestic fuels and the automobile industry, are obtained from petroleum. Hydrocarbons are classified as open chain saturated(alkanes) and unsaturated(alkenes and alkynes), cyclic(alicyclic) and aromatic, according to their structure. The important reactions of alkanes are free radical substitution, combustion, oxidation and aromatization. Alkenes and alkynes undergo addition reactions, which are mainly electrophilic additions. Aromatic hydrocarbons, despite having unsaturation, undergo mainly electrophilic substitution reactions. These undergo addition reactions only under special conditions. Alkanes show conformational isomerism due to free rotation along the C C sigma bonds. Out of staggered and the eclipsed conformations of ethane, staggered conformation is more stable as hydrogen atoms are farthest apart. Alkenes exhibit geometrical(cis - trans) isomerism due to restricted rotation around the carbon carbon double bond. Benzene and benzenoid compounds show aromatic character. Aromaticity, the property of being aromatic is possessed by compounds having specific electronic structure characterised by Hückel(4n + 2) electron rule. The nature of groups or substituents attached to benzene ring is responsible for activation or deactivation of the benzene ring towards further electrophilic substitution and also for orientation of the incoming group. Some of the polynuclear hydrocarbons having fused benzene ring system have carcinogenic property.
