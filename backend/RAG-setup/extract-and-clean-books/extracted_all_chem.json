This will be followed by\nstudying the properties of the solutions, like vapour\npressure and colligative properties. We will begin with\ntypes of solutions and then various alternatives in\nwhich concentrations of a solute can be expressed in\nliquid solution.\n11111.....11111 TTTTTyyyyypppppeeeeesssss ooooofffff Solutions are homogeneous mixtures of two or more than two\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss components. By homogenous mixture we mean that its composition\nand properties are uniform throughout the mixture. Generally, the\ncomponent that is present in the largest quantity is known as solvent.\nSolvent determines the physical state in which solution exists. One or\nmore components present in the solution other than solvent are called\nsolutes. In this Unit we shall consider only binary solutions (i.e.,\nReprint 2025-26\nconsisting of two components). Here each component may be\nsolid, liquid or in gaseous state and are summarised in Table 1.1.\nTable 1.1: Types of Solutions\nType of Solution Solute Solvent Common Examples\nGaseous Solutions Gas Gas Mixture of oxygen and nitrogen gases\nLiquid Gas Chloroform mixed with nitrogen gas\nSolid Gas Camphor in nitrogen gas\nLiquid Solutions Gas Liquid Oxygen dissolved in water\nLiquid Liquid Ethanol dissolved in water\nSolid Liquid Glucose dissolved in water\nSolid Solutions Gas Solid Solution of hydrogen in palladium\nLiquid Solid Amalgam of mercury with sodium\nSolid Solid Copper dissolved in gold\nComposition of a solution can be described by expressing its\n11111.....22222 EEEEExxxxxppppprrrrreeeeessssssssssiiiiinnnnnggggg\nconcentration. The latter can be expressed either qualitatively\nCCCCCooooonnnnnccccceeeeennnnntttttrrrrraaaaatttttiiiiiooooonnnnn or quantitatively. For example, qualitatively we can say that the\nooooofffff SSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss solution is dilute (i.e., relatively very small quantity of solute)\nor it is concentrated (i.e., relatively very large quantity of\nsolute). But in real life these kinds of description can add to\nlot of confusion and thus the need for a quantitative description\nof the solution.\nThere are several ways by which we can describe the concentration\nof the solution quantitatively.\n(i) Mass percentage (w/w): The mass percentage of a component of a\nsolution is defined as:\nMass % of a component\nMass of the component in the solution\n= 100 (1.1)\nTotal mass of the solution\nFor example, if a solution is described by 10% glucose in water by\nmass, it means that 10g of glucose is dissolved in 90 g of water\nresulting in a 100 g solution. Concentration described by mass\npercentage is commonly used in industrial chemical applications.\nFor example, commercial bleaching solution contains 3.62 mass\npercentage of sodium hypochlorite in water.\n(ii) Volume percentage (V/V): The volume percentage is defined as:\nVolume of the component\nVolume % of a component = 100\nTotal volume of solution\n(1.2)\nChemistry 2\nReprint 2025-26\nFor example, 10% ethanol solution in water means that 10 mL\nof ethanol is dissolved in water such that the total volume of\nthe solution is 100 mL. Solutions containing liquids are commonly\nexpressed in this unit. For example, a 35% (v/v) solution of\nethylene glycol, an antifreeze, is used in cars for cooling the\nengine. At this concentration the antifreeze lowers the freezing\npoint of water to 255.4K (–17.6°C).\n(iii) Mass by volume percentage (w/V): Another unit which is\ncommonly used in medicine and pharmacy is mass by\nvolume percentage. It is the mass of solute dissolved in\n100 mL of the solution.\n(iv) Parts per million: When a solute is present in trace quantities, it\nis convenient to express concentration in parts per million (ppm)\nand is defined as:\nParts per million =\nNumberof parts of the component\n×106 (1.3)\nTotal number of parts of all components of the solution\nAs in the case of percentage, concentration in parts per million can\nalso be expressed as mass to mass, volume to volume and mass to\nvolume. A litre of sea water (which weighs 1030 g) contains about\n6 × 10–3 g of dissolved oxygen (O ). Such a small concentration is\n2\nalso expressed as 5.8 g per 106 g (5.8 ppm) of sea water. The\nconcentration of pollutants in water or atmosphere is often expressed\nin terms of mg mL–1 or ppm.\n(v) Mole fraction: Commonly used symbol for mole fraction is x and\nsubscript used on the right hand side of x denotes the component.\nIt is defined as:\nMole fraction of a component =\nNumber of moles of the component\n(1.4)\nTotal number of moles of all the components\nFor example, in a binary mixture, if the number of moles of A and B are\nn and n respectively, the mole fraction of A will be\nA B\nn\nx = A (1.5)\nA n  n\nA B\nFor a solution containing i number of components, we have:\nn n\nx = i = i (1.6)\ni n  n .......n n\n1 2 i i\nIt can be shown that in a given solution sum of all the mole\nfractions is unity, i.e.\nx + x + .................. + x = 1 (1.7)\n1 2 i\nMole fraction unit is very useful in relating some physical properties\nof solutions, say vapour pressure with the concentration of the\nsolution and quite useful in describing the calculations involving\ngas mixtures.\n3 Solutions\nReprint 2025-26\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 11111.....11111 Calculate the mole fraction of ethylene glycol (C H O ) in a solution\n2 6 2\ncontaining 20% of C H O by mass.\n2 6 2\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn Assume that we have 100 g of solution (one can start with any amount of\nsolution because the results obtained will be the same).

Mass %, ppm, mole fraction and molality\nare independent of temperature, whereas molarity is a function of\ntemperature. This is because volume depends on temperature\nand the mass does not.\nCalculate molality of 2.5 g of ethanoic acid (CH COOH) in 75 g of benzene.

It depends\nupon the nature of solute and solvent as well as temperature and\npressure. Let us consider the effect of these factors in solution of a solid\nor a gas in a liquid.\n5 Solutions\nReprint 2025-26\n1.3.1 Solubility of Every solid does not dissolve in a given liquid. While sodium chloride\na Solid in a and sugar dissolve readily in water, naphthalene and anthracene do\nLiquid not. On the other hand, naphthalene and anthracene dissolve readily in\nbenzene but sodium chloride and sugar do not. It is observed that\npolar solutes dissolve in polar solvents and non polar solutes in non-\npolar solvents. In general, a solute dissolves in a solvent if the\nintermolecular interactions are similar in the two or we may say like\ndissolves like.\nWhen a solid solute is added to the solvent, some solute dissolves\nand its concentration increases in solution. This process is known as\ndissolution. Some solute particles in solution collide with the solid solute\nparticles and get separated out of solution. This process is known as\ncrystallisation. A stage is reached when the two processes occur at the\nsame rate. Under such conditions, number of solute particles going\ninto solution will be equal to the solute particles separating out and\na state of dynamic equilibrium is reached.\nSolute + Solvent ⇌ Solution (1.10)\nAt this stage the concentration of solute in solution will remain\nconstant under the given conditions, i.e., temperature and pressure.\nSimilar process is followed when gases are dissolved in liquid solvents.\nSuch a solution in which no more solute can be dissolved at the same\ntemperature and pressure is called a saturated solution. An\nunsaturated solution is one in which more solute can be dissolved at\nthe same temperature. The solution which is in dynamic equilibrium\nwith undissolved solute is the saturated solution and contains the\nmaximum amount of solute dissolved in a given amount of solvent.\nThus, the concentration of solute in such a solution is its solubility.\nEarlier we have observed that solubility of one substance into\nanother depends on the nature of the substances. In addition to these\nvariables, two other parameters, i.e., temperature and pressure also\ncontrol this phenomenon.\nEffect of temperature\nThe solubility of a solid in a liquid is significantly affected by temperature\nchanges. Consider the equilibrium represented by equation 1.10. This,\nbeing dynamic equilibrium, must follow Le Chateliers Principle. In\ngeneral, if in a nearly saturated solution, the dissolution process is\nendothermic (D H > 0), the solubility should increase with rise in\nsol\ntemperature and if it is exothermic (D H<0) the solubility should\nsol\ndecrease. These trends are also observed experimentally.\nEffect of pressure\nPressure does not have any significant effect on solubility of solids in\nliquids. It is so because solids and liquids are highly incompressible\nand practically remain unaffected by changes in pressure.\n1.3.2 Solubility of Many gases dissolve in water. Oxygen dissolves only to a small extent\na Gas in a in water. It is this dissolved oxygen which sustains all aquatic life. On\nLiquid the other hand, hydrogen chloride gas (HCl) is highly soluble in water.\nSolubility of gases in liquids is greatly affected by pressure and\nChemistry 6\nReprint 2025-26\ntemperature. The solubility of gases increase with increase of pressure.\nFor solution of gases in a solvent, consider a system as shown in\nFig. 1.1 (a). The lower part is solution and the upper part is gaseous\nsystem at pressure p and temperature T. Assume this system to be in\na state of dynamic equilibrium, i.e., under these conditions rate of\ngaseous particles entering and leaving the solution phase is the same.\nNow increase the pressure over the solution phase by compressing the\ngas to a smaller volume [Fig. 1.1 (b)]. This will increase the number of\ngaseous particles per unit volume over the solution and also the rate\nat which the gaseous particles are striking the surface of solution to\nenter it. The solubility of the gas will increase until a new equilibrium\nis reached resulting in an increase in the pressure of a gas above the\nsolution and thus its solubility increases.\nHenry was the first to give a\nquantitative relation between\npressure and solubility of a gas in\na solvent which is known as\nHenry’s law. The law states that\nat a constant temperature, the\nsolubility of a gas in a liquid is\ndirectly proportional to the\npartial pressure of the gas\npresent above the surface of\nliquid or solution. Dalton, a\ncontemporary of Henry, also\nFig. 1.1: Effect of pressure on the solubility of a gas. The concluded independently that the\nconcentration of dissolved gas is proportional to the\nsolubility of a gas in a liquid\npressure on the gas above the solution.\nsolution is a function of partial\npressure of the gas. If we use the mole fraction of a gas in\nthe solution as a measure of its solubility, then it can be\nsaid that the mole fraction of gas in the solution is\nproportional to the partial pressure of the gas over\nthe solution. The most commonly used form of Henry’s\nlaw states that “the partial pressure of the gas in\nvapour phase (p) is proportional to the mole fraction\nof the gas (x) in the solution” and is expressed as:\np = K x (1.11)\nH\nHere K is the Henry’s law constant. If we draw a\nH\ngraph between partial pressure of the gas versus mole\nfraction of the gas in solution, then we should get a plot\nof the type as shown in Fig. 1.2.\nDifferent gases have different K values at the same\nH\ntemperature (Table 1.2). This suggests that K is a\nH\nfunction of the nature of the gas.\nIt is obvious from equation (1.11) that higher the\nFig. 1.2: Experimental results for\nvalue of K at a given pressure, the lower is the solubility\nthe solubility of HCl gas in H\ncyclohexane at 293 K.

Assume that N exerts a partial\n2\npressure of 0.987 bar. Given that Henry’s law constant for N at 293 K is\n2\n76.48 kbar.\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn The solubility of gas is related to the mole fraction in aqueous solution.\nThe mole fraction of the gas in the solution is calculated by applying\nHenry’s law. Thus:\np (nitrogen) 0.987bar\nx (Nitrogen) = = = 1.29 × 10–5\nK 76,480 bar\nH\nAs 1 litre of water contains 55.5 mol of it, therefore if n represents\nnumber of moles of N in solution,\n2\nn mol n\nx (Nitrogen) = = = 1.29 × 10–5\nn mol+55.5 mol 55.5\n(n in denominator is neglected as it is < < 55.5)\nThus n = 1.29 × 10–5 × 55.5 mol = 7.16 × 10–4 mol\n7.16×104 mol × 1000 mmol\n= = 0.716 mmol\n1 mol\nHenry’s law finds several applications in industry and explains some\nbiological phenomena. Notable among these are:\n• To increase the solubility of CO in soft drinks and soda water, the\n2\nbottle is sealed under high pressure.\n• Scuba divers must cope with high concentrations of dissolved gases\nwhile breathing air at high pressure underwater. Increased pressure\nincreases the solubility of atmospheric gases in blood. When the\ndivers come towards surface, the pressure gradually decreases. This\nreleases the dissolved gases and leads to the formation of bubbles\nof nitrogen in the blood. This blocks capillaries and creates a medical\ncondition known as bends, which are painful and dangerous to life.\nChemistry 8\nReprint 2025-26\nTo avoid bends, as well as, the toxic effects of high concentrations\nof nitrogen in the blood, the tanks used by scuba divers are filled\nwith air diluted with helium (11.7% helium, 56.2% nitrogen and\n32.1% oxygen).\n• At high altitudes the partial pressure of oxygen is less than that at\nthe ground level. This leads to low concentrations of oxygen in the\nblood and tissues of people living at high altitudes or climbers. Low\nblood oxygen causes climbers to become weak and unable to think\nclearly, symptoms of a condition known as anoxia.\nEffect of Temperature\nSolubility of gases in liquids decreases with rise in temperature. When\ndissolved, the gas molecules are present in liquid phase and the process\nof dissolution can be considered similar to condensation and heat\nis evolved in this process. We have learnt in the last Section that\ndissolution process involves dynamic equilibrium and thus must\nfollow Le Chatelier’s Principle. As dissolution is an exothermic\nprocess, the solubility should decrease with increase of\ntemperature.\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n1.6 H S, a toxic gas with rotten egg like smell, is used for the qualitative analysis.

In this Section, we shall discuss the\nLLLLLiiiiiqqqqquuuuuiiiiiddddd\nsolutions of liquids and solids in a liquid. Such solutions may contain\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\none or more volatile components. Generally, the liquid solvent is volatile.\nThe solute may or may not be volatile. We shall discuss the properties\nof only binary solutions, that is, the solutions containing two\ncomponents, namely, the solutions of (i) liquids in liquids and (ii) solids\nin liquids.\n1.4.1 Vapour Let us consider a binary solution of two volatile liquids and denote the\nPressure of two components as 1 and 2. When taken in a closed vessel, both the\nLiquid- components would evaporate and eventually an equilibrium would be\nLiquid established between vapour phase and the liquid phase. Let the total\nSolutions vapour pressure at this stage be p and p and p be the partial\ntotal 1 2\nvapour pressures of the two components 1 and 2 respectively. These\npartial pressures are related to the mole fractions x and x of the two\n1 2\ncomponents 1 and 2 respectively.\nThe French chemist, Francois Marte Raoult (1886) gave the\nquantitative relationship between them. The relationship is known as\nthe Raoult’s law which states that for a solution of volatile liquids,\n9 Solutions\nReprint 2025-26\nthe partial vapour pressure of each component of the solution\nis directly proportional to its mole fraction present in solution.\nThus, for component 1\np (cid:181) x\n1 1\nand p = p0 x (1.12)\n1 1 1\nwhere p0 is the vapour pressure of pure component 1 at the same\n1\ntemperature.\nSimilarly, for component 2\np = p 0 x (1.13)\n2 2 2\nwhere p 0 represents the vapour pressure of the pure component 2.\n2\nAccording to Dalton’s law of partial pressures, the total pressure\n(p ) over the solution phase in the container will be the sum of the\ntotal\npartial pressures of the components of the solution and is given as:\np = p + p (1.14)\ntotal 1 2\nSubstituting the values of p and p , we get\n1 2\np = x p 0 + x p 0\ntotal 1 1 2 2\n= (1 – x ) p 0 + x p 0 (1.15)\n2 1 2 2\n= p 0 + (p 0 – p 0) x (1.16)\n1 2 1 2\nFollowing conclusions can be drawn from equation (1.16).\n(i) Total vapour pressure over the solution can be related to the mole\nfraction of any one component.\n(ii) Total vapour pressure over the solution varies linearly with the\nmole fraction of component 2.\n(iii) Depending on the vapour pressures\nof the pure components 1 and 2,\ntotal vapour pressure over the\nsolution decreases or increases with\nthe increase of the mole fraction of\ncomponent 1.\nA plot of p or p versus the mole\n1 2\nfractions x and x for a solution gives a\n1 2\nlinear plot as shown in Fig. 1.3. These\nlines (I and II) pass through the points for\nwhich x and x are equal to unity.\n1 2\nSimilarly the plot (line III) of p versus\ntotal\nx is also linear (Fig. 1.3).

Thus, Raoult’s law becomes\nH 1\na special case of Henry’s law in which K becomes equal to p 0.\nH 1\n1.4.3 Vapour Another important class of solutions consists of solids dissolved in\nPressure of liquid, for example, sodium chloride, glucose, urea and cane sugar in\nSolutions of water and iodine and sulphur dissolved in carbon disulphide. Some\nSolids in physical properties of these solutions are quite different from those of\nLiquids pure solvents. For example, vapour pressure. Liquids at a given\ntemperature vapourise and under\nequilibrium conditions the pressure exerted\nby the vapours of the liquid over the liquid\nphase is called vapour pressure [Fig. 1.4 (a)].\nIn a pure liquid the entire surface is\noccupied by the molecules of the liquid. If a\nnon-volatile solute is added to a solvent to\ngive a solution [Fig. 1.4.(b)], the vapour\npressure of the solution is solely from the\nsolvent alone. This vapour pressure of the\nsolution at a given temperature is found to\nbe lower than the vapour pressure of the\npure solvent at the same temperature. In\nFig. 1.4: Decrease in the vapour pressure of the the solution, the surface has both solute and\nsolvent on account of the presence of solvent molecules; thereby the fraction of the\nsolute in the solvent (a) evaporation of the surface covered by the solvent molecules gets\nmolecules of the solvent from its surface\nreduced. Consequently, the number of\nis denoted by , (b) in a solution, solute\nsolvent molecules escaping from the surface\nparticles have been denoted by and they\nis correspondingly reduced, thus, the vapour\nalso occupy part of the surface area.\npressure is also reduced.\nThe decrease in the vapour pressure of solvent depends on the\nquantity of non-volatile solute present in the solution, irrespective of\nits nature. For example, decrease in the vapour pressure of water by\nadding 1.0 mol of sucrose to one kg of water is nearly similar to that\nproduced by adding 1.0 mol of urea to the same quantity of water at\nthe same temperature.\nRaoult’s law in its general form can be stated as, for any solution\nthe partial vapour pressure of each volatile component in the\nsolution is directly proportional to its mole fraction.\nIn a binary solution, let us denote the solvent by 1 and solute by\n2. When the solute is non-volatile, only the solvent molecules are\npresent in vapour phase and contribute to vapour pressure. Let p be\n1\nChemistry 12\nReprint 2025-26\nthe vapour pressure of the solvent, x be\n1\nits mole fraction, p0 be its vapour pressure\ni\nin the pure state.

The ideal solutions have\ntwo other important properties. The enthalpy of mixing of the\npure components to form the solution is zero and the volume\nof mixing is also zero, i.e.,\nD H = 0, D V = 0 (1.21)\nmix mix\nIt means that no heat is absorbed or evolved when the components\nare mixed. Also, the volume of solution would be equal to the sum of\nvolumes of the two components. At molecular level, ideal behaviour of\nthe solutions can be explained by considering two components A and\nB. In pure components, the intermolecular attractive interactions will\nbe of types A-A and B-B, whereas in the binary solutions in addition\nto these two interactions, A-B type of interactions will also be present.\nIf the intermolecular attractive forces between the A-A and B-B are\nnearly equal to those between A-B, this leads to the formation of ideal\nsolution. A perfectly ideal solution is rare but some solutions are nearly\nideal in behaviour. Solution of n-hexane and n-heptane, bromoethane\nand chloroethane, benzene and toluene, etc. fall into this category.\n1.5.2 Non-ideal When a solution does not obey Raoult’s law over the entire range of\nSolutions concentration, then it is called non-ideal solution. The vapour pressure\nof such a solution is either higher or lower than that predicted by\nRaoult’s law (equation 1.16). If it is higher, the solution exhibits positive\ndeviation and if it is lower, it exhibits negative deviation from Raoult’s\nlaw. The plots of vapour pressure as a function of mole fractions\nfor such solutions are shown in Fig. 1.6.\nThe cause for these deviations lie in the nature of interactions at the\nmolecular level. In case of positive deviation from Raoult’s law, A-B\ninteractions are weaker than those between A-A or B-B, i.e., in this case\nthe intermolecular attractive forces between the solute-solvent molecules\nare weaker than those between the solute-solute and solvent-solvent\nmolecules. This means that in such solutions, molecules of A (or B) will\nfind it easier to escape than in pure state. This will increase the vapour\n13 Solutions\nReprint 2025-26\nFig.1.6\nThe vapour\npressures of two\ncomponent systems\nas a function of\ncomposition (a) a\nsolution that shows\npositive deviation\nfrom Raoult's law\nand (b) a solution\nthat shows negative\ndeviation from\nRaoult's law.\npressure and result in positive deviation. Mixtures of ethanol and acetone\nbehave in this manner. In pure ethanol, molecules are hydrogen bonded.\nOn adding acetone, its molecules get in between the host molecules and\nbreak some of the hydrogen bonds between them. Due to weakening of\ninteractions, the solution shows positive deviation from Raoult’s law\n[Fig. 1.6 (a)]. In a solution formed by adding carbon disulphide to\nacetone, the dipolar interactions between solute-solvent molecules are\nweaker than the respective interactions among the solute-solute and\nsolvent-solvent molecules. This solution also shows positive deviation.\nIn case of negative deviations from Raoult’s law, the intermolecular\nattractive forces between A-A and B-B are weaker than those between\nA-B and leads to decrease in vapour pressure resulting in negative\ndeviations. An example of this type is a mixture of phenol and aniline.\nIn this case the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between phenolic\nproton and lone pair on nitrogen atom of aniline is stronger than the\nrespective intermolecular hydrogen bonding between similar\nmolecules. Similarly, a mixture of chloroform and acetone\nforms a solution with negative deviation from Raoult’s law.\nThis is because chloroform molecule is able to form hydrogen\nbond with acetone molecule as shown.\nThis decreases the escaping tendency of molecules for each\ncomponent and consequently the vapour pressure decreases resulting\nin negative deviation from Raoult’s law [Fig. 1.6. (b)].\nSome liquids on mixing, form azeotropes which are binary mixtures\nhaving the same composition in liquid and vapour phase and boil at\na constant temperature. In such cases, it is not possible to separate the\ncomponents by fractional distillation. There are two types of azeotropes\ncalled minimum boiling azeotrope and maximum boiling\nazeotrope. The solutions which show a large positive deviation from\nRaoult’s law form minimum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition.\nChemistry 14\nReprint 2025-26\nFor example, ethanol-water mixture (obtained by fermentation of sugars)\non fractional distillation gives a solution containing approximately 95%\nby volume of ethanol. Once this composition, known as azeotrope\ncomposition, has been achieved, the liquid and vapour have the same\ncomposition, and no further separation occurs.\nThe solutions that show large negative deviation from Raoult’s law\nform maximum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition. Nitric acid\nand water is an example of this class of azeotrope. This azeotrope has\nthe approximate composition, 68% nitric acid and 32% water by mass,\nwith a boiling point of 393.5 K.\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\n1.8 The vapour pressure of pure liquids A and B are 450 and 700 mm Hg\nrespectively, at 350 K .

Such properties are called\ncolligative properties (colligative: from Latin: co means together, ligare\nmeans to bind). In the following Sections we will discuss these\nproperties one by one.\n1.6.1 Relative We have learnt in Section 1.4.3 that the vapour pressure of a solvent in\nLowering of solution is less than that of the pure solvent. Raoult established that the\nVapour lowering of vapour pressure depends only on the concentration of the\nPressure solute particles and it is independent of their identity.

It boils at the temperature at which its vapour pressure\nis equal to the atmospheric pressure. For example, water boils at\n373.15 K (100° C) because at this temperature the vapour pressure\nof water is 1.013 bar (1 atmosphere). We have also learnt in the last\nsection that vapour pressure of the solvent decreases in the presence\nof non-volatile solute. Fig. 1.7 depicts the variation of vapour pressure\nof the pure solvent and solution as a function of temperature. For\nexample, the vapour pressure of an aqueous solution of sucrose is\nless than 1.013 bar at 373.15 K. In order to make this solution\nboil, its vapour pressure must be increased to 1.013 bar by\nraising the temperature above the boiling temperature of\nthe pure solvent (water). Thus, the boiling point of a solution is\nChemistry 16\nReprint 2025-26\nalways higher than that of the boiling point of\nthe pure solvent in which the solution is prepared\n1.013 bar as shown in Fig. 1.7. Similar to lowering of vapour\nor pressure, the elevation of boiling point also\ndepends on the number of solute molecules\nrather than their nature. A solution of 1 mol of\nsucrose in 1000 g of water boils at 373.52 K at\none atmospheric pressure.\nLet T0 be the boiling point of pure solvent and\nb\nT be the boiling point of solution.

Thus, the\nfreezing point of a substance may be defined as\nthe temperature at which the vapour pressure of\nthe substance in its liquid phase is equal to its\nvapour pressure in the solid phase. A solution\nwill freeze when its vapour pressure equals the\nvapour pressure of the pure solid solvent as is\nclear from Fig. 1.8.

Small solvent\nChemistry 20\nReprint 2025-26\nmolecules, like water, can pass through these holes but the passage of\nbigger molecules like solute is hindered. Membranes having this kind\nof properties are known as semipermeable membranes (SPM).\nAssume that only solvent molecules can pass through these semi-\npermeable membranes. If this membrane is placed between the solvent\nand solution as shown in Fig. 1.9, the solvent molecules will flow through\nthe membrane from pure solvent to the solution. This process of flow\nof the solvent is called osmosis.\nThe flow will continue till the equilibrium is attained. The flow of the\nsolvent from its side to solution side across a semipermeable membrane\ncan be stopped if some extra pressure is applied on the solution. This\npressure that just stops the flow of solvent is called osmotic\npressure of the solution. The flow of solvent from dilute solution to\nthe concentrated solution across a semipermeable membrane is due to\nosmosis. The important point to be kept in mind is that solvent molecules\nalways flow from lower concentration to higher concentration of solution.\nThe osmotic pressure has been found to depend on the concentration\nof the solution.\nThe osmotic pressure of a solution is the\nexcess pressure that must be applied to a\nsolution to prevent osmosis, i.e., to stop the\npassage of solvent molecules through a\nsemipermeable membrane into the solution. This\nis illustrated in Fig. 1.10. Osmotic pressure is a\ncolligative property as it depends on the number\nof solute molecules and not on their identity.\nFor dilute solutions, it has been found\nexperimentally that osmotic pressure is\nproportional to the molarity, C of the\nsolution at a given temperature T. Thus:\nP = C R T (1.39)\nFig. 1.10: The excess pressure equal to the\nHere P is the osmotic pressure and R is the\nosmotic pressure must be applied on\ngas constant.\nthe solution side to prevent osmosis.\nP = (n /V) R T (1.40)\n2\nHere V is volume of a solution in litres containing n moles of solute.\n2\nIf w grams of solute, of molar mass, M is present in the solution, then\n2 2\nn = w / M and we can write,\n2 2 2\nw R T\nP V = 2 (1.41)\nM\n2\nw R T\nor M = 2 (1.42)\n2 (cid:213) V\nThus, knowing the quantities w , T, P and V we can calculate the\n2\nmolar mass of the solute.\nMeasurement of osmotic pressure provides another method of\ndetermining molar masses of solutes. This method is widely used to\ndetermine molar masses of proteins, polymers and other\n21 Solutions\nReprint 2025-26\nmacromolecules. The osmotic pressure method has the advantage over\nother methods as pressure measurement is around the room\ntemperature and the molarity of the solution is used instead of molality.\nAs compared to other colligative properties, its magnitude is large\neven for very dilute solutions. The technique of osmotic pressure for\ndetermination of molar mass of solutes is particularly useful for\nbiomolecules as they are generally not stable at higher temperatures\nand polymers have poor solubility.\nTwo solutions having same osmotic pressure at a given\ntemperature are called isotonic solutions. When such solutions\nare separated by semipermeable membrane no osmosis occurs\nbetween them. For example, the osmotic pressure associated\nwith the fluid inside the blood cell is equivalent to that of\n0.9% (mass/volume) sodium chloride solution, called normal saline\nsolution and it is safe to inject intravenously. On the other hand, if\nwe place the cells in a solution containing more than 0.9% (mass/\nvolume) sodium chloride, water will flow out of the cells and they\nwould shrink. Such a solution is called hypertonic. If the salt\nconcentration is less than 0.9% (mass/volume), the solution is said\nto be hypotonic. In this case, water will flow into the cells if placed\nin this solution and they would swell.\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 11111.....1111111111 200 cm3 of an aqueous solution of a protein contains 1.26 g of the\nprotein.

A raw mango placed in concentrated\nsalt solution loses water via osmosis and shrivel into pickle. Wilted\nflowers revive when placed in fresh water. A carrot that has become\nlimp because of water loss into the atmosphere can be placed into the\nwater making it firm once again. Water will move into its cells through\nosmosis. When placed in water containing less than 0.9% (mass/\nvolume) salt, blood cells swell due to flow of water in them by osmosis.\nPeople taking a lot of salt or salty food experience water retention in\ntissue cells and intercellular spaces because of osmosis. The resulting\nChemistry 22\nReprint 2025-26\npuffiness or swelling is called edema. Water movement from soil into\nplant roots and subsequently into upper portion of the plant is partly\ndue to osmosis. The preservation of meat by salting and of fruits by\nadding sugar protects against bacterial action. Through the process\nof osmosis, a bacterium on salted meat or candid fruit loses water,\nshrivels and dies.\n1.6.5 Reverse The direction of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure larger than the\nOsmosis and osmotic pressure is applied to the solution side. That is, now the\nWater pure solvent flows out of the solution through the semi permeable\nPurification membrane. This phenomenon is called reverse osmosis and is of\ngreat practical utility. Reverse osmosis is used in desalination of sea\nwater. A schematic set up for the process is shown in Fig. 1.11.\nWhen pressure more than osmotic pressure is\napplied, pure water is squeezed out of the sea\nwater through the membrane. A variety of\nΠ\npolymer membranes are available for this\npurpose.\nThe pressure required for the reverse osmosis\nis quite high. A workable porous membrane is a\nfilm of cellulose acetate placed over a suitable\nsupport. Cellulose acetate is permeable to water\nbut impermeable to impurities and ions present\nin sea water. These days many countries use\nFig. 1.11: Reverse osmosis occurs when a\npressure larger than the osmotic desalination plants to meet their potable water\npressure is applied to the solution. requirements.\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n1.9 Vapour pressure of pure water at 298 K is 23.8 mm Hg. 50 g of urea\n(NH CONH ) is dissolved in 850 g of water. Calculate the vapour pressure\n2 2\nof water for this solution and its relative lowering.\n1.10 Boiling point of water at 750 mm Hg is 99.63°C.

For example, if we dissolve one mole of KCl (74.5 g)\nin water, we expect one mole each of K+ and Cl– ions to be released in\nMMMMMaaaaasssssssssseeeeesssss\nthe solution. If this happens, there would be two moles of particles in\nthe solution. If we ignore interionic attractions, one mole of KCl in\none kg of water would be expected to increase the boiling point by\n2 × 0.52 K = 1.04 K. Now if we did not know about the degree of\n23 Solutions\nReprint 2025-26\ndissociation, we could be led to conclude that the mass of 2 mol particles\nis 74.5 g and the mass of one mole of KCl would be 37.25 g. This\nbrings into light the rule that, when there is dissociation of solute into\nions, the experimentally determined molar mass is always lower than\nthe true value.\n2 CH COOH ⇌ (CH COOH) Molecules of ethanoic acid (acetic acid) dimerise in\n3 3 2\nbenzene due to hydrogen bonding. This normally happens\nin solvents of low dielectric constant. In this case the number\nof particles is reduced due to dimerisation. Association of\nmolecules is depicted as follows:\nIt can be undoubtedly stated here that if all the molecules of ethanoic\nacid associate in benzene, then DT or DT for ethanoic acid will be half\nb f\nof the normal value. The molar mass calculated on the basis of this DT\nb\nor DT will, therefore, be twice the expected value. Such a molar mass\nf\nthat is either lower or higher than the expected or normal value is called\nas abnormal molar mass.\nIn 1880 van’t Hoff introduced a factor i, known as the van’t Hoff\nfactor, to account for the extent of dissociation or association. This\nfactor i is defined as:\nNormal molar mass\ni \nAbnormal molar mass\nObserved colligative property\n\nCalculated colligative property\nTotal number of moles of particles after association/dissociation\ni \nNumber of moles of particles before association/dissociation\nHere abnormal molar mass is the experimentally determined molar\nmass and calculated colligative properties are obtained by assuming\nthat the non-volatile solute is neither associated nor dissociated. In\ncase of association, value of i is less than unity while for dissociation it\nis greater than unity. For example, the value of i for aqueous KCl\nsolution is close to 2, while the value for ethanoic acid in benzene is\nnearly 0.5.\nInclusion of van’t Hoff factor modifies the equations for colligative\nproperties as follows:\nRelative lowering of vapour pressure of solvent,\npo – p n\n1 1 i. 2\npo n\n1 1\nElevation of Boiling point, DT = i K m\nb b\nDepression of Freezing point, DT = i K m\nf f\nOsmotic pressure of solution, P = i n R T / V\n2\nChemistry 24\nReprint 2025-26\nTable 1.4 depicts values of the factor, i for several strong electrolytes.\nFor KCl, NaCl and MgSO , i values approach 2 as the solution becomes\n4\nvery dilute.

Solutions are\nclassified as solid, liquid and gaseous solutions. The concentration of a solution is\nexpressed in terms of mole fraction, molarity, molality and in percentages. The\ndissolution of a gas in a liquid is governed by Henry’s law, according to which, at a\ngiven temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to\nthe partial pressure of the gas. The vapour pressure of the solvent is lowered by\nthe presence of a non-volatile solute in the solution and this lowering of vapour\npressure of the solvent is governed by Raoult’s law, according to which the relative\nlowering of vapour pressure of the solvent over a solution is equal to the mole\nfraction of a non-volatile solute present in the solution. However, in a binary\nliquid solution, if both the components of the solution are volatile then another\nform of Raoult’s law is used. Mathematically, this form of the Raoult’s law is stated\nas:p  p0x p0x . Solutions which obey Raoult’s law over the entire range\ntotal 1 1 2 2\nof concentration are called ideal solutions. Two types of deviations from Raoult’s\nlaw, called positive and negative deviations are observed. Azeotropes arise due to\nvery large deviations from Raoult’s law.\nThe properties of solutions which depend on the number of solute particles and\nare independent of their chemical identity are called colligative properties. These\nare lowering of vapour pressure, elevation of boiling point, depression of freezing\npoint and osmotic pressure. The process of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure\nhigher than the osmotic pressure is applied to the solution. Colligative properties\nhave been used to determine the molar mass of solutes. Solutes which dissociate in\nsolution exhibit molar mass lower than the actual molar mass and those which\nassociate show higher molar mass than their actual values.\nQuantitatively, the extent to which a solute is dissociated or associated can be\nexpressed by van’t Hoff factor i. This factor has been defined as ratio of normal\nmolar mass to experimentally determined molar mass or as the ratio of observed\ncolligative property to the calculated colligative property.\nEEEEExxxxxeeeeerrrrrccccciiiiissssseeeeesssss\n1.1 Define the term solution.

In this device the Gibbs energy of the spontaneous\nredox reaction is converted into electrical work which may be used for\nrunning a motor or other electrical gadgets like heater, fan,\ngeyser, etc.\nDaniell cell discussed earlier is one such cell in which the following\nredox reaction occurs.\nZn(s) + Cu2+(aq) fi Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s)\nThis reaction is a combination of two half reactions whose addition\ngives the overall cell reaction:\n(i) Cu2+ + 2e– fi Cu(s) (reduction half reaction) (2.2)\n(ii) Zn(s) fi Zn2+ + 2e– (oxidation half reaction) (2.3)\nThese reactions occur in two different portions of the Daniell cell.\nThe reduction half reaction occurs on the copper electrode while the\noxidation half reaction occurs on the zinc electrode. These two portions\nof the cell are also called half-cells or redox couples. The copper\nelectrode may be called the reduction half cell and the zinc electrode,\nthe oxidation half-cell.\nWe can construct innumerable number of galvanic cells on the pattern\nof Daniell cell by taking combinations of different half-cells. Each half-\ncell consists of a metallic electrode dipped into an electrolyte. The two\nhalf-cells are connected by a metallic wire through a voltmeter and a\nswitch externally. The electrolytes of the two half-cells are connected\ninternally through a salt bridge as shown in Fig. 2.1. Sometimes, both\nthe electrodes dip in the same electrolyte solution and in such cases we\ndo not require a salt bridge.\nAt each electrode-electrolyte interface there is a tendency of metal\nions from the solution to deposit on the metal electrode trying to make\nit positively charged. At the same time, metal atoms of the electrode\nhave a tendency to go into the solution as ions and leave behind the\nelectrons at the electrode trying to make it negatively charged. At\nequilibrium, there is a separation of charges and depending on the\ntendencies of the two opposing reactions, the electrode may be positively\nor negatively charged with respect to the solution. A potential difference\ndevelops between the electrode and the electrolyte which is called\nelectrode potential. When the concentrations of all the species involved\nin a half-cell is unity then the electrode potential is known as standard\nelectrode potential. According to IUPAC convention, standard\nreduction potentials are now called standard electrode potentials. In a\ngalvanic cell, the half-cell in which oxidation takes place is called anode\nand it has a negative potential with respect to the solution. The other\nhalf-cell in which reduction takes place is called cathode and it has a\npositive potential with respect to the solution. Thus, there exists a\npotential difference between the two electrodes and as soon as the\nswitch is in the on position the electrons flow from negative electrode\nto positive electrode. The direction of current flow is opposite to that of\nelectron flow.\n33 Electrochemistry\nReprint 2025-26\nThe potential difference between the two electrodes of a galvanic\ncell is called the cell potential and is measured in volts. The cell\npotential is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction\npotentials) of the cathode and anode. It is called the cell electromotive\nforce (emf) of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell. It\nis now an accepted convention that we keep the anode on the left and\nthe cathode on the right while representing the galvanic cell. A galvanic\ncell is generally represented by putting a vertical line between metal\nand electrolyte solution and putting a double vertical line between\nthe two electrolytes connected by a salt bridge. Under this convention\nthe emf of the cell is positive and is given by the potential of the half-\ncell on the right hand side minus the potential of the half-cell on the\nleft hand side i.e.,\nE = E – E\ncell right left\nThis is illustrated by the following example:\nCell reaction:\nCu(s) + 2Ag+(aq) (cid:190)fi Cu2+(aq) + 2 Ag(s) (2.4)\nHalf-cell reactions:\nCathode (reduction): 2Ag+(aq) + 2e– fi 2Ag(s) (2.5)\nAnode (oxidation): Cu(s) fi Cu2+(aq) + 2e– (2.6)\nIt can be seen that the sum of (3.5) and (3.6) leads to overall reaction\n(2.4) in the cell and that silver electrode acts as a cathode and copper\nelectrode acts as an anode. The cell can be represented as:\nCu(s)|Cu2+(aq)||Ag+(aq)|Ag(s)\nand we have E = E – E = E – E (2.7)\ncell right left Ag+œAg Cu2+œCu\n2.2.1 The potential of individual half-cell cannot be measured. We can\nMeasurement measure only the difference between the two half-cell potentials that\nof Electrode gives the emf of the cell. If we arbitrarily choose the potential of one\nPotential electrode (half-cell) then that of the other can be determined with respect\nto this. According to convention, a half-cell\ncalled standard hydrogen electrode (Fig.3.3)\nrepresented by Pt(s)œ H (g)œ H+(aq), is assigned\n2\na zero potential at all temperatures\ncorresponding to the reaction\n1\nH+ (aq) + e– fi H (g)\n2 2\nThe standard hydrogen electrode consists\nof a platinum electrode coated with platinum\nblack. The electrode is dipped in an acidic\nsolution and pure hydrogen gas is bubbled\nthrough it. The concentration of both the\nreduced and oxidised forms of hydrogen is\nmaintained at unity (Fig. 2.3). This implies\nthat the pressure of hydrogen gas is one bar\nand the concentration of hydrogen ion in the\nFig. 2.3: Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE). solution is one molar.\nChemistry 34\nReprint 2025-26\nAt 298 K the emf of the cell, standard hydrogen electrode (cid:231)(cid:231)second\nhalf-cell constructed by taking standard hydrogen electrode as anode\n(reference half-cell) and the other half-cell as cathode, gives the reduction\npotential of the other half-cell. If the concentrations of the oxidised and\nthe reduced forms of the species in the right hand half-cell are unity,\nthen the cell potential is equal to standard electrode potential, Eo of\nR\nthe given half-cell.\nEo = Eo – Eo\nR L\nAs Eo for standard hydrogen electrode is zero.\nL\nEo = Eo – 0 = Eo\nR R\nThe measured emf of the cell:\nPt(s) (cid:231) H (g, 1 bar) (cid:231) H+ (aq, 1 M) (cid:231)(cid:231) Cu2+ (aq, 1 M) œ Cu\n2\nis 0.34 V and it is also the value for the standard electrode potential\nof the half-cell corresponding to the reaction:\nCu2+ (aq, 1M) + 2 e– fi Cu(s)\nSimilarly, the measured emf of the cell:\nPt(s) (cid:231) H (g, 1 bar) (cid:231) H+ (aq, 1 M) (cid:231)(cid:231) Zn2+ (aq, 1M) (cid:231) Zn\n2\nis -0.76 V corresponding to the standard electrode potential of the\nhalf-cell reaction:\nZn2+ (aq, 1 M) + 2e– fi Zn(s)\nThe positive value of the standard electrode potential in the first\ncase indicates that Cu2+ ions get reduced more easily than H+ ions. The\nreverse process cannot occur, that is, hydrogen ions cannot oxidise Cu\n(or alternatively we can say that hydrogen gas can reduce copper ion)\nunder the standard conditions described above. Thus, Cu does not\ndissolve in HCl. In nitric acid it is oxidised by nitrate ion and not by\nhydrogen ion. The negative value of the standard electrode potential\nin the second case indicates that hydrogen ions can oxidise zinc (or\nzinc can reduce hydrogen ions).\nIn view of this convention, the half reaction for the Daniell cell in\nFig. 2.1 can be written as:\nLeft electrode: Zn(s) fi Zn2+ (aq, 1 M) + 2 e–\nRight electrode: Cu2+ (aq, 1 M) + 2 e– fi Cu(s)\nThe overall reaction of the cell is the sum of above two reactions\nand we obtain the equation:\nZn(s) + Cu2+ (aq) fi Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s)\nemf of the cell = Eo = Eo – Eo\ncell R L\n= 0.34V – (–0.76)V = 1.10 V\nSometimes metals like platinum or gold are used as inert electrodes.\nThey do not participate in the reaction but provide their surface for\noxidation or reduction reactions and for the conduction of electrons.\nFor example, Pt is used in the following half-cells:\nHydrogen electrode: Pt(s)|H (g)| H+(aq)\n2\nWith half-cell reaction: H+ (aq)+ e– fi ½ H (g)\n2\nBromine electrode: Pt(s)|Br (aq)| Br–(aq)\n2\n35 Electrochemistry\nReprint 2025-26\nWith half-cell reaction: ½ Br (aq) + e– fi Br–(aq)\n2\nThe standard electrode potentials are very important and we can\nextract a lot of useful information from them. The values of standard\nelectrode potentials for some selected half-cell reduction reactions are\ngiven in Table 2.1. If the standard electrode potential of an electrode\nis greater than zero then its reduced form is more stable compared to\nhydrogen gas. Similarly, if the standard electrode potential is negative\nthen hydrogen gas is more stable than the reduced form of the species.\nIt can be seen that the standard electrode potential for fluorine is the\nhighest in the Table indicating that fluorine gas (F ) has the maximum\n2\ntendency to get reduced to fluoride ions (F–) and therefore fluorine\ngas is the strongest oxidising agent and fluoride ion is the weakest\nreducing agent. Lithium has the lowest electrode potential indicating\nthat lithium ion is the weakest oxidising agent while lithium metal is\nthe most powerful reducing agent in an aqueous solution. It may be\nseen that as we go from top to bottom in Table 2.1 the standard\nelectrode potential decreases and with this, decreases the oxidising\npower of the species on the left and increases the reducing power of\nthe species on the right hand side of the reaction. Electrochemical\ncells are extensively used for determining the pH of solutions, solubility\nproduct, equilibrium constant and other thermodynamic properties\nand for potentiometric titrations.\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n2.1 How would you determine the standard electrode potential of the system\nMg2+|Mg?\n2.2 Can you store copper sulphate solutions in a zinc pot?\n2.3 Consult the table of standard electrode potentials and suggest three\nsubstances that can oxidise ferrous ions under suitable conditions.\n22222.....33333 NNNNNeeeeerrrrrnnnnnsssssttttt\nWe have assumed in the previous section that the concentration of all\nEEEEEqqqqquuuuuaaaaatttttiiiiiooooonnnnn the species involved in the electrode reaction is unity.

It also\ndepends on the temperature and pressure at which the measurements\nare made. Materials are classified into conductors, insulators and\nsemiconductors depending on the magnitude of their conductivity. Metals\nand their alloys have very large conductivity and are known as conductors.\nCertain non-metals like carbon-black, graphite and some organic\npolymers* are also electronically conducting. Substances like glass,\nceramics, etc., having very low conductivity are known as insulators.\nSubstances like silicon, doped silicon and gallium arsenide having\nconductivity between conductors and insulators are called\nsemiconductors and are important electronic materials. Certain materials\ncalled superconductors by definition have zero resistivity or infinite\nconductivity. Earlier, only metals and their alloys at very low temperatures\n(0 to 15 K) were known to behave as superconductors, but nowadays a\nnumber of ceramic materials and mixed oxides are also known to show\nsuperconductivity at temperatures as high as 150 K.\nElectrical conductance through metals is called metallic or electronic\nconductance and is due to the movement of electrons. The electronic\nconductance depends on\n(i) the nature and structure of the metal\n(ii) the number of valence electrons per atom\n(iii) temperature (it decreases with increase of temperature).\n* Electronically conducting polymers – In 1977 MacDiarmid, Heeger and Shirakawa discovered that acetylene gas can be\npolymerised to produce a polymer, polyacetylene when exposed to vapours of iodine acquires metallic lustre and\nconductivity. Since then several organic conducting polymers have been made such as polyaniline, polypyrrole and\npolythiophene. These organic polymers which have properties like metals, being composed wholly of elements like\ncarbon, hydrogen and occasionally nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur, are much lighter than normal metals and can be used\nfor making light-weight batteries. Besides, they have the mechanical properties of polymers such as flexibility so that\none can make electronic devices such as transistors that can bend like a sheet of plastic. For the discovery of conducting\npolymers, MacDiarmid, Heeger and Shirakawa were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the year 2000.\nChemistry 42\nReprint 2025-26\nAs the electrons enter at one end and go out through the other end,\nthe composition of the metallic conductor remains unchanged. The\nmechanism of conductance through semiconductors is more complex.\nWe already know that even very pure water has small amounts of\nhydrogen and hydroxyl ions (~10–7M) which lend it very low conductivity\n(3.5 × 10–5 S m–1). When electrolytes are dissolved in water, they furnish\ntheir own ions in the solution hence its conductivity also increases. The\nconductance of electricity by ions present in the solutions is called\nelectrolytic or ionic conductance. The conductivity of electrolytic (ionic)\nsolutions depends on:\n(i) the nature of the electrolyte added\n(ii) size of the ions produced and their solvation\n(iii) the nature of the solvent and its viscosity\n(iv) concentration of the electrolyte\n(v) temperature (it increases with the increase of temperature).\nPassage of direct current through ionic solution over a prolonged\nperiod can lead to change in its composition due to electrochemical\nreactions (Section 2.4.1).\n2.4.1 Measurement We know that accurate measurement of an unknown resistance can be\nof the performed on a Wheatstone bridge. However, for measuring the resistance\nConductivity of an ionic solution we face two problems. Firstly, passing direct current\nof Ionic (DC) changes the composition of the solution. Secondly, a solution cannot\nSolutions be connected to the bridge like a metallic wire or other solid conductor.\nThe first difficulty is resolved by using an alternating current (AC) source\nof power. The second problem is solved by using a specially designed\nvessel called conductivity cell. It is available in several designs and two\nsimple ones are shown in Fig. 2.4.\nConnecting\nConnecting wires\nwires\nPlatinized Pt\nFig. 2.4 electrodes\nTwo different types of\nconductivity cells. Platinized Pt electrode Platinized Pt electrode\nBasically it consists of two platinum electrodes coated with platinum\nblack (finely divided metallic Pt is deposited on the electrodes\nelectrochemically). These have area of cross section equal to ‘A’ and are\nseparated by distance ‘l’. Therefore, solution confined between these\nelectrodes is a column of length l and area of cross section A. The\nresistance of such a column of solution is then given by the equation:\nl l\nR = r = (2.17)\nA A\n43 Electrochemistry\nReprint 2025-26\nThe quantity l/A is called cell constant denoted by the symbol, G*.\nIt depends on the distance between the electrodes and their area of\ncross-section and has the dimension of length–1 and can be calculated\nif we know l and A. Measurement of l and A is not only inconvenient\nbut also unreliable. The cell constant is usually determined by measuring\nthe resistance of the cell containing a solution whose conductivity is\nalready known. For this purpose, we generally use KCl solutions whose\nconductivity is known accurately at various concentrations (Table 2.3)\nand at different temperatures. The cell constant, G*, is then given by\nthe equation:\nl\nG* = = R k (2.18)\nA\nTable 2.3: Conductivity and Molar conductivity of KCl solutions\nat 298.15K\nConcentration/Molarity Conductivity Molar Conductivity\nmol L–1 mol m–3 S cm–1 S m–1 S cm2mol–1 S m2 mol–1\n1.000 1000 0.1113 11.13 111.3 111.3×10–4\n0.100 100.0 0.0129 1.29 129.0 129.0×10–4\n0.010 10.00 0.00141 0.141 141.0 141.0×10–4\nOnce the cell constant is determined, we can\nuse it for measuring the resistance or conductivity\nof any solution.

The\n2\nWheatstone bridge is fed by an oscillator O (a\nsource of a.c. power in the audio frequency range\n550 to 5000 cycles per second). P is a suitable\ndetector (a headphone or other electronic device)\nand the bridge is balanced when no current passes\nthrough the detector. Under these conditions:\nFig. 2.5: Arrangement for measurement of R R\nUnknown resistance R = 1 4 (2.19)\nresistance of a solution of an 2 R\nelectrolyte. 3\nThese days, inexpensive conductivity meters are\navailable which can directly read the conductance or resistance of the\nsolution in the conductivity cell.

It, therefore, becomes\nnecessary to define a physically more meaningful quantity called molar\nconductivity denoted by the symbol L (Greek, lambda). It is related\nm\nto the conductivity of the solution by the equation:\n\nMolar conductivity = L = (2.21)\nm c\nIn the above equation, if k is expressed in S m–1 and the concentration,\nc in mol m–3 then the units of L are in S m2 mol–1.

Conductivity always decreases with\nand Molar decrease in concentration both, for weak and strong electrolytes.\nConductivity This can be explained by the fact that the number of ions per unit\nwith volume that carry the current in a solution decreases on dilution.\nConcentration The conductivity of a solution at any given concentration is the\nconductance of one unit volume of solution kept between two\nChemistry 46\nReprint 2025-26\nplatinum electrodes with unit area of cross section and at a distance\nof unit length. This is clear from the equation:\nA\nG = =  (both A and l are unity in their appropriate units in\nl\nm or cm)\nMolar conductivity of a solution at a given concentration is the\nconductance of the volume V of solution containing one mole of\nelectrolyte kept between two electrodes with area of cross section A and\ndistance of unit length. Therefore,\nκA\nΛ = =κ\nm l\nSince l = 1 and A = V ( volume containing 1 mole of electrolyte)\nL = k V (2.22)\nm\nMolar conductivity increases with\ndecrease in concentration. This is\nbecause the total volume, V, of solution\ncontaining one mole of electrolyte also\nincreases. It has been found that decrease\nin k on dilution of a solution is more\nthan compensated by increase in its\nvolume. Physically, it means that at a\ngiven concentration, L can be defined\nm\nas the conductance of the electrolytic\nsolution kept between the electrodes of a\nconductivity cell at unit distance but\nhaving area of cross section large enough\nto accommodate sufficient volume of\nsolution that contains one mole of the\nelectrolyte. When concentration\napproaches zero, the molar conductivity\nis known as limiting molar\nconductivity and is represented by the\nFig. 2.6: Molar conductivity versus c½ for acetic\nacid (weak electrolyte) and potassium symbol L(cid:176) m . The variation in L m with\nchloride (strong electrolyte) in aqueous concentration is different (Fig. 2.6) for\nsolutions. strong and weak electrolytes.\nStrongElectrolytes\nFor strong electrolytes, L increases slowly with dilution and can be\nm\nrepresented by the equation:\nL = L(cid:176) – A c ½ (2.23)\nm m\nIt can be seen that if we plot (Fig. 2.6) L against\nm\nc1/2, we obtain a straight line with intercept equal to L(cid:176) and slope\nm\nequal to ‘–A’. The value of the constant ‘A’ for a given solvent and\ntemperature depends on the type of electrolyte i.e., the charges on the\ncation and anion produced on the dissociation of the electrolyte in the\nsolution. Thus, NaCl, CaCl , MgSO are known as 1-1, 2-1 and 2-2\n2 4\nelectrolytes respectively.

He noted that the difference in m of\nthe electrolytes NaX and KX for any X is nearly constant. For example\nat 298 K:\nL(cid:176)\nm (KCl) –\nL(cid:176)\nm (NaCl) =\nL(cid:176)\nm (KBr) –\nL(cid:176)\nm (NaBr)\n= L(cid:176)\nm (KI)\n– L(cid:176)\nm (NaI)\n≃ 23.4 S cm2 mol–1\nand similarly it was found that\nL(cid:176)\nm (NaBr)\n– L(cid:176)\nm (NaCl)\n= L(cid:176)\nm (KBr)\n– L(cid:176)\nm (KCl)\n≃ 1.8 S cm2 mol–1\nOn the basis of the above observations he enunciated Kohlrausch\nlaw of independent migration of ions.

Thus,\nif\nl(cid:176)\n+and\nl°\n– are limiting molar conductivity of the sodium and chloride\nNa Cl\nions respectively, then the limiting molar conductivity for sodium chloride\nis given by the equation:\nL(cid:176)\nm =\nl(cid:176)\n+ +\nl(cid:176)\n– (2.24)\n(NaCl) Na Cl\nn n\nIn general, if an electrolyte on dissociation gives cations and\n+ –\nanions then its limiting molar conductivity is given by:\nL(cid:176)\nm =\nn\n+\nl(cid:176)\n+\n+\nn\n–\nl(cid:176)\n–\n(2.25)\nHere,\nl(cid:176)\nand\nl(cid:176)\nare the limiting molar conductivities of the cation\nand anion r\n+\nespectiv\n–\nely.

In such cases m increases steeply (Fig. 2.6) on\nL(cid:176)\ndilution, especially near lower concentrations. Therefore, m cannot be\nL\nobtained by extrapolation of m to zero concentration. At infinite dilution\n(i.e., concentration c fi zero) electrolyte dissociates completely (a =1),\nbut at such low concentration the conductivity of the solution is so low\nL(cid:176)\nthat it cannot be measured accurately.

At the anode, copper is\nconverted into Cu2+ ions by the reaction:\nCu(s) fi Cu2+(s) + 2e– (2.29)\nThus copper is dissolved (oxidised) at anode and deposited\n(reduced) at cathode. This is the basis for an industrial process in\nwhich impure copper is converted into copper of high purity. The\nimpure copper is made an anode that dissolves on passing current\nand pure copper is deposited at the cathode. Many metals like Na, Mg,\nAl, etc. are produced on large scale by electrochemical reduction of\ntheir respective cations where no suitable chemical reducing agents\nare available for this purpose.\nSodium and magnesium metals are produced by the electrolysis of\ntheir fused chlorides and aluminium is produced by electrolysis of\naluminium oxide in presence of cryolite.\nQuantitative Aspects of Electrolysis\nMichael Faraday was the first scientist who described the quantitative\naspects of electrolysis. Now Faraday’s laws also flow from what has\nbeen discussed earlier.\nFaraday’s Laws of Electrolysis\nAfter his extensive investigations on electrolysis of solutions and melts\nof electrolytes, Faraday published his results during 1833-34 in the\nform of the following well known Faraday’s two laws of electrolysis:\n(i) First Law: The amount of chemical reaction which occurs at any\nelectrode during electrolysis by a current is proportional to the\nquantity of electricity passed through the electrolyte (solution or\nmelt).\n(ii) Second Law: The amounts of different substances liberated by the\nsame quantity of electricity passing through the electrolytic solution\nare proportional to their chemical equivalent weights (Atomic Mass\nof Metal ÷ Number of electrons required to reduce the cation).\n51 Electrochemistry\nReprint 2025-26\nThere were no constant current sources available during Faraday’s\ntimes. The general practice was to put a coulometer (a standard electrolytic\ncell) for determining the quantity of electricity passed from the amount\nof metal (generally silver or copper) deposited or consumed. However,\ncoulometers are now obsolete and we now have constant current (I)\nsources available and the quantity of electricity Q, passed is given by\nQ = It\nQ is in coloumbs when I is in ampere and t is in second.\nThe amount of electricity (or charge) required for oxidation or\nreduction depends on the stoichiometry of the electrode reaction. For\nexample, in the reaction:\nAg +(aq) + e– fi Ag(s) (2.30)\nOne mole of the electron is required for the reduction of one mole\nof silver ions.\nWe know that charge on one electron is equal to 1.6021 × 10–19C.\nTherefore, the charge on one mole of electrons is equal to:\nN ×1.6021×10–19 C = 6.02×1023mol–1×1.6021×10–19\nA\nC = 96487 C mol–1\nThis quantity of electricity is called Faraday and is represented by\nthe symbol F.\nFor approximate calculations we use 1F ≃ 96500 C mol–1.\nFor the electrode reactions:\nMg2+(l) + 2e– (cid:190)fi Mg(s) (2.31)\nAl3+(l) + 3e– (cid:190)fi Al(s) (2.32)\nIt is obvious that one mole of Mg2+ and Al3+ require 2 mol of electrons\n(2F) and 3 mol of electrons (3F) respectively. The charge passed through\nthe electrolytic cell during electrolysis is equal to the product of current\nin amperes and time in seconds. In commercial production of metals,\ncurrent as high as 50,000 amperes are used that amounts to about\n0.518 F per second.\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 22222.....1111100000 A solution of CuSO is electrolysed for 10 minutes with a current of\n4\n1.5 amperes.

If the electrode is\ninert (e.g., platinum or gold), it does not participate in the chemical\nreaction and acts only as source or sink for electrons. On the other\nhand, if the electrode is reactive, it participates in the electrode reaction.\nThus, the products of electrolysis may be different for reactive and inert\nChemistry 52\nReprint 2025-26\nelectrodes.The products of electrolysis depend on the different oxidising\nand reducing species present in the electrolytic cell and their standard\nelectrode potentials. Moreover, some of the electrochemical processes\nalthough feasible, are so slow kinetically that at lower voltages these do\nnot seem to take place and extra potential (called overpotential) has to\nbe applied, which makes such process more difficult to occur.\nFor example, if we use molten NaCl, the products of electrolysis are\nsodium metal and Cl gas. Here we have only one cation (Na+) which is\n2\nreduced at the cathode (Na+ + e– fi Na) and one anion (Cl–) which is\noxidised at the anode (Cl– fi ½Cl + e– ) . During the electrolysis of aqueous\n2\nsodium chloride solution, the products are NaOH, Cl and H . In this\n2 2\ncase besides Na+ and Cl– ions we also have H+ and OH– ions along with\nthe solvent molecules, H O.\n2\nAt the cathode there is competition between the following reduction\nreactions:\nNa+ (aq) + e– fi Na (s) Eo = – 2.71 V\n(cell)\nH+ (aq) + e– fi ½ H (g) Eo = 0.00 V\n2 (cell)\nThe reaction with higher value of\nEo\nis preferred and therefore, the\nreaction at the cathode during electrolysis is:\nH+ (aq) + e– fi ½ H (g) (2.33)\n2\nbut H+ (aq) is produced by the dissociation of H O, i.e.,\n2\nH O (l) fi H+ (aq) + OH– (aq) (2.34)\n2\nTherefore, the net reaction at the cathode may be written as the sum\nof (2.33) and (2.34) and we have\nH O (l) + e– fi ½H (g) + OH– (2.35)\n2 2\nAt the anode the following oxidation reactions are possible:\nCl– (aq) fi ½ Cl (g) + e– Eo = 1.36 V (2.36)\n2\n(cell)\n2H O(l) fi O (g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e– Eo = 1.23 V (2.37)\n2 2\n(cell)\nThe reaction at anode with lower value of Eo is preferred and\ntherefore, water should get oxidised in preference to Cl– (aq).

However, for a battery to be of practical\nuse it should be reasonably light, compact and its voltage should not\nvary appreciably during its use. There are mainly two types of batteries.\n2.6.1 Primary In the primary batteries, the reaction occurs only once and after use\nBatteries over a period of time battery becomes dead and cannot be reused\nagain. The most familiar example of this type is the dry\ncell (known as Leclanche cell after its discoverer) which is\nused commonly in our transistors and clocks. The cell\nconsists of a zinc container that also acts as anode and\nthe cathode is a carbon (graphite) rod surrounded by\npowdered manganese dioxide and carbon (Fig.2.8). The\nspace between the electrodes is filled by a moist paste of\nammonium chloride (NH Cl) and zinc chloride (ZnCl ). The\n4 2\nelectrode reactions are complex, but they can be written\napproximately as follows :\nAnode: Zn(s) (cid:190)fi Zn2+ + 2e–\nCathode: MnO + NH ++ e–(cid:190)fi MnO(OH) + NH\n2 4 3\nIn the reaction at cathode, manganese is reduced\nfrom the + 4 oxidation state to the +3 state. Ammonia\nproduced in the reaction forms a complex with Zn2+ to give\n[Zn (NH ) ]2+. The cell has a potential of nearly 1.5 V.\n34\nMercury cell, (Fig. 2.9) suitable for low current devices\nlike hearing aids, watches, etc. consists of zinc – mercury\namalgam as anode and a paste of HgO and carbon as the\nFig. 2.8: A commercial dry cell cathode. The electrolyte is a paste of KOH and ZnO.

A\ngood secondary cell can undergo a large number of discharging\nand charging cycles. The most important secondary cell is the lead\nstorage battery (Fig. 2.10) commonly used in automobiles and\ninvertors. It consists of a lead anode and a grid of lead packed with\nlead dioxide (PbO ) as cathode. A 38% solution of sulphuric acid\n2\nis used as an electrolyte.\nThe cell reactions when the battery is in use are given below:\nAnode: Pb(s) + SO 2–(aq) fi PbSO (s) + 2e–\n4 4\nCathode: PbO (s) + SO 2–(aq) + 4H+(aq) + 2e– fi PbSO (s) + 2H O(l)\n2 4 4 2\ni.e., overall cell reaction consisting of cathode and anode reactions is:\nPb(s) + PbO (s) + 2H SO (aq) fi 2PbSO (s) + 2H O(l)\n2 2 4 4 2\nOn charging the battery the reaction is reversed and PbSO (s) on\n4\nanode and cathode is converted into Pb and PbO , respectively.\n2\nFig. 2.10: The Lead storage battery.\n55 Electrochemistry\nReprint 2025-26\nAnother important secondary\ncell is the nickel-cadmium cell\n(Fig. 2.11) which has longer life\nthan the lead storage cell but\nmore expensive to manufacture.\nFig. 2.11\nA rechargeable We shall not go into details of\nnickel-cadmium cell working of the cell and the\nPositive plate\nin a jelly roll electrode reactions during\narrangement and Separator charging and discharging.\nseparated by a layer The overall reaction during\nNegative plate\nsoaked in moist\ndischarge is:\nsodium or potassium\nhydroxide.\nCd (s) + 2Ni(OH) (s) fi CdO (s) + 2Ni(OH) (s) + H O (l)\n3 2 2\n22222.....77777 FFFFFuuuuueeeeelllll CCCCCeeeeellllllllllsssss Production of electricity by thermal plants is not a very efficient method\nand is a major source of pollution. In such plants, the chemical energy\n(heat of combustion) of fossil fuels (coal, gas or oil) is first used for\nconverting water into high pressure steam. This is then used to run\na turbine to produce electricity. We know that a galvanic cell directly\nconverts chemical energy into electricity and is highly efficient. It is\nnow possible to make such cells in which reactants are fed continuously\nto the electrodes and products are removed continuously from the\nelectrolyte compartment. Galvanic cells that are designed to convert\nthe energy of combustion of fuels like hydrogen, methane, methanol,\netc. directly into electrical energy are called fuel cells.\nOne of the most successful fuel cells\nuses the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen\nto form water (Fig. 2.12). The cell was\nused for providing electrical power in the\nApollo space programme. The water\nvapours produced during the reaction\nwere condensed and added to the\ndrinking water supply for the astronauts.\nIn the cell, hydrogen and oxygen are\nbubbled through porous carbon\nelectrodes into concentrated aqueous\nsodium hydroxide solution.

The rusting of iron, tarnishing of silver,\ndevelopment of green coating on copper and bronze are some of the\nexamples of corrosion. It causes enormous damage to\nbuildings, bridges, ships and to all objects made of\nmetals especially that of iron. We lose crores of rupees\nevery year on account of corrosion.\nIn corrosion, a metal is oxidised by loss of electrons\nto oxygen and formation of oxides. Corrosion of iron\n(commonly known as rusting) occurs in presence of\nwater and air. The chemistry of corrosion is quite\ncomplex but it may be considered\nOxidation: Fe (s)fi Fe2+ (aq) +2e–\nessentially as an electrochemical\nReduction: O (g) + 4H+(aq) +4e– fi 2H O(l)\n2 2 phenomenon. At a particular spot\nAtomospheric\n(Fig. 2.13) of an object made of iron,\noxidation: 2Fe2+(aq) + 2H O(l) + ½O (g) fi Fe O (s) + 4H+(aq)\n2 2 2 3 oxidation takes place and that spot\nbehaves as anode and we can write\nFig. 2.13: Corrosion of iron in atmosphere\nthe reaction\nEo\nAnode: 2 Fe (s) (cid:190)fi 2 Fe2+ + 4 e– = – 0.44 V\n(Fe2+/Fe)\nElectrons released at anodic spot move through the metal and go\nto another spot on the metal and reduce oxygen in the presence of H+\n(which is believed to be available from H CO formed due to dissolution\n2 3\nof carbon dioxide from air into water. Hydrogen ion in water may also\nbe available due to dissolution of other acidic oxides from the\natmosphere).

It not only saves\nmoney but also helps in preventing accidents such as a bridge collapse\nor failure of a key component due to corrosion. One of the simplest\nmethods of preventing corrosion is to prevent the surface of the metallic\nobject to come in contact with atmosphere. This can be done by covering\nthe surface with paint or by some chemicals (e.g. bisphenol). Another\nsimple method is to cover the surface by other metals (Sn, Zn, etc.) that\nare inert or react to save the object. An electrochemical method is to\nprovide a sacrificial electrode of another metal (like Mg, Zn, etc.) which\ncorrodes itself but saves the object.\n57 Electrochemistry\nReprint 2025-26\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n2.13 Write the chemistry of recharging the lead storage battery, highlighting\nall the materials that are involved during recharging.\n2.14 Suggest two materials other than hydrogen that can be used as fuels in\nfuel cells.\n2.15 Explain how rusting of iron is envisaged as setting up of an\nelectrochemical cell.\nTTTTThhhhheeeee HHHHHyyyyydddddrrrrrooooogggggeeeeennnnn EEEEEcccccooooonnnnnooooommmmmyyyyy\nAt present the main source of energy that is driving our economy is fossil fuels\nsuch as coal, oil and gas. As more people on the planet aspire to improve their\nstandard of living, their energy requirement will increase. In fact, the per\ncapita consumption of energy used is a measure of development. Of course, it\nis assumed that energy is used for productive purpose and not merely wasted.\nWe are already aware that carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of fossil\nfuels is resulting in the ‘Greenhouse Effect’. This is leading to a rise in the\ntemperature of the Earth’s surface, causing polar ice to melt and ocean levels\nto rise. This will flood low-lying areas along the coast and some island nations\nsuch as Maldives face total submergence. In order to avoid such a catastrope,\nwe need to limit our use of carbonaceous fuels. Hydrogen provides an ideal\nalternative as its combustion results in water only. Hydrogen production must\ncome from splitting water using solar energy. Therefore, hydrogen can be used\nas a renewable and non polluting source of energy. This is the vision of the\nHydrogen Economy. Both the production of hydrogen by electrolysis of water\nand hydrogen combustion in a fuel cell will be important in the future. And\nboth these technologies are based on electrochemical principles.\nSSSSSuuuuummmmmmmmmmaaaaarrrrryyyyy\nAn electrochemical cell consists of two metallic electrodes dipping in electrolytic\nsolution(s). Thus an important component of the electrochemical cell is the ionic\nconductor or electrolyte. Electrochemical cells are of two types. In galvanic cell,\nthe chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction is converted into electrical\nwork, whereas in an electrolytic cell, electrical energy is used to carry out a non-\nspontaneous redox reaction. The standard electrode potential for any electrode\ndipping in an appropriate solution is defined with respect to standard electrode\npotential of hydrogen electrode taken as zero. The standard potential of the cell\ncan be obtained by taking the difference of the standard potentials of cathode and\nanode ( E ( o cell) = Eo cathode – Eo anode). The standard potential of the cells are\nrelated to standard Gibbs energy (DrGo = –nFE ( o cell)) and equilibrium constant\n(DrGo = – RT ln K) of the reaction taking place in the cell. Concentration dependence\nof the potentials of the electrodes and the cells are given by Nernst equation.\nThe conductivity, k, of an electrolytic solution depends on the concentration\nof the electrolyte, nature of solvent and temperature. Molar conductivity, L m, is\ndefined by = k/c where c is the concentration. Conductivity decreases but molar\nconductivity increases with decrease in concentration. It increases slowly with\ndecrease in concentration for strong electrolytes while the increase is very steep\nfor weak electrolytes in very dilute solutions. Kohlrausch found that molar\nconductivity at infinite dilution, for an electrolyte is sum of the contribution of the\nChemistry 58\nReprint 2025-26\nmolar conductivity of the ions in which it dissociates. It is known as law of\nindependent migration of ions and has many applications. Ions conduct electricity\nthrough the solution but oxidation and reduction of the ions take place at the\nelectrodes in an electrochemical cell. Batteries and fuel cells are very useful\nforms of galvanic cell. Corrosion of metals is essentially an electrochemical\nphenomenon.

The word kinetics is derived from\nthe Greek word ‘kinesis’ meaning movement.\nThermodynamics tells only about the feasibility of a\nreaction whereas chemical kinetics tells about the rate\nof a reaction. For example, thermodynamic data\nindicate that diamond shall convert to graphite but\nin reality the conversion rate is so slow that the change\nis not perceptible at all. Therefore, most people think\nReprint 2025-26\nthat diamond is forever. Kinetic studies not only help us to determine\nthe speed or rate of a chemical reaction but also describe the\nconditions by which the reaction rates can be altered. The factors\nsuch as concentration, temperature, pressure and catalyst affect the\nrate of a reaction. At the macroscopic level, we are interested in\namounts reacted or formed and the rates of their consumption or\nformation. At the molecular level, the reaction mechanisms involving\norientation and energy of molecules undergoing collisions,\nare discussed.\nIn this Unit, we shall be dealing with average and instantaneous\nrate of reaction and the factors affecting these. Some elementary\nideas about the collision theory of reaction rates are also given.\nHowever, in order to understand all these, let us first learn about the\nreaction rate.\n33333.....11111 RRRRRaaaaattttteeeee ooooofffff aaaaa\nSome reactions such as ionic reactions occur very fast, for example,\nCCCCChhhhheeeeemmmmmiiiiicccccaaaaalllll precipitation of silver chloride occurs instantaneously by mixing of\naqueous solutions of silver nitrate and sodium chloride.

Also there are reactions like inversion\nof cane sugar and hydrolysis of starch, which proceed with a moderate\nspeed. Can you think of more examples from each category?\nYou must be knowing that speed of an automobile is expressed in\nterms of change in the position or distance covered by it in a certain\nperiod of time. Similarly, the speed of a reaction or the rate of a\nreaction can be defined as the change in concentration of a reactant\nor product in unit time. To be more specific, it can be expressed in\nterms of:\n(i) the rate of decrease in concentration of any one of the\nreactants,or\n(ii) the rate of increase in concentration of any one of the products.\nConsider a hypothetical reaction, assuming that the volume of the\nsystem remains constant.\nR fi P\nOne mole of the reactant R produces one mole of the product P.

For example, if concentration is in mol L–1 and\ntime is in seconds then the units will be mol L-1s–1.

So in problem 3.1, r at 600s for example, can be\ninst\ncalculated by plotting concentration of butyl chloride as a function of\ntime. A tangent is drawn that touches the curve at t = 600 s (Fig. 3.2).\nThe slope of this tangent gives the instantaneous rate.\nSo, r at 600 s = – mol L–1 = 5.12 × 10–5 mol L–1s–1\ninst\nAt t = 250 s r = 1.22 × 10–4mol L–1s–1\ninst\nt = 350 s r = 1.0 × 10–4 mol L–1s–1\ninst\nt = 450 s r = 6.4 ×× 10–5 mol L–1s–1\ninst\nNow consider a reaction\nHg(l) + Cl (g) fiHgCl (s)\n2 2\nWhere stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants and products are\nsame, then rate of the reaction is given as\n[ ] [ ] [ ]\nD Hg D Cl D HgCl\nRate of reaction = – = – 2 = 2\nD t D t D t\ni.e., rate of disappearance of any of the reactants is same as the rate\nof appearance of the products.

Since\nrate of consumption of HI is twice the rate of formation of H or I , to\n2 2\nmake them equal, the term D[HI] is divided by 2.

The\nConcentration representation of rate of reaction in terms of concentration of the\nreactants is known as rate law. It is also called as rate equation or\nrate expression.\n3.2.2 Rate The results in Table 3.1 clearly show that rate of a reaction decreases with\nExpression the passage of time as the concentration of reactants decrease. Conversely,\nand Rate rates generally increase when reactant concentrations increase. So, rate of\nConstant a reaction depends upon the concentration of reactants.\nChemistry 66\nReprint 2025-26\nConsider a general reaction\naA + bB fi cC + dD\nwhere a, b, c and d are the stoichiometric coefficients of reactants\nand products.\nThe rate expression for this reaction is\nRate (cid:181) [A]x [B]y (3.4)\nwhere exponents x and y may or may not be equal to the\nstoichiometric coefficients (a and b) of the reactants. Above equation\ncan also be written as\nRate = k [A]x [B]y (3.4a)\n[ ]\n- d R = k [ A ]x[ B ]y (3.4b)\ndt\nThis form of equation (3.4 b) is known as differential rate equation,\nwhere k is a proportionality constant called rate constant. The\nequation like (3.4), which relates the rate of a reaction to concentration\nof reactants is called rate law or rate expression. Thus, rate law is the\nexpression in which reaction rate is given in terms of molar\nconcentration of reactants with each term raised to some\npower, which may or may not be same as the stoichiometric\ncoefficient of the reacting species in a balanced chemical\nequation. For example:\n2NO(g) + O (g) fi 2NO (g)\n2 2\nWe can measure the rate of this reaction as a function of initial\nconcentrations either by keeping the concentration of one of the reactants\nconstant and changing the concentration of the other reactant or by\nchanging the concentration of both the reactants. The following results\nare obtained (Table 3.2).\nTable 3.2: Initial rate of formation of NO\n2\nExperiment Initial [NO]/ mol L-1 Initial [O ]/ mol L-1 Initial rate of\n2\nformation of NO / mol L-1s-1\n2\n1. 0.30 0.30 0.096\n2. 0.60 0.30 0.384\n3. 0.30 0.60 0.192\n4. 0.60 0.60 0.768\nIt is obvious, after looking at the results, that when the concentration\nof NO is doubled and that of O is kept constant then the initial rate\n2\nincreases by a factor of four from 0.096 to 0.384 mol L–1s–1. This\nindicates that the rate depends upon the square of the concentration of\nNO. When concentration of NO is kept constant and concentration of\nO is doubled the rate also gets doubled indicating that rate depends\n2\non concentration of O to the first power. Hence, the rate equation for\n2\nthis reaction will be\nRate = k [NO]2[O ]\n2\n67 Chemical Kinetics\nReprint 2025-26\nThe differential form of this rate expression is given as\n[ ]\n- d R = k [ NO ]2 [ O ]\ndt 2\nNow, we observe that for this reaction in the rate equation derived\nfrom the experimental data, the exponents of the concentration terms\nare the same as their stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced\nchemical equation.\nSome other examples are given below:\nReaction Experimental rate expression\n1. CHCl + Cl fi CCl + HCl Rate = k [CHCl ] [Cl ]1/2\n3 2 4 3 2\n2. CHCOOCH + HO fi CHCOOH + CHOH Rate = k[CH COOCH ]1 [H O]0\n3 2 5 2 3 2 5 3 2 5 2\nIn these reactions, the exponents of the concentration terms are not\nthe same as their stoichiometric coefficients. Thus, we can say that:\nRate law for any reaction cannot be predicted by merely looking at\nthe balanced chemical equation, i.e., theoretically but must be determined\nexperimentally.\n3.2.3 Order of a In the rate equation (3.4)\nReaction Rate = k [A]x [B]y\nx and y indicate how sensitive the rate is to the change in concentration\nof A and B. Sum of these exponents, i.e., x + y in (3.4) gives the overall\norder of a reaction whereas x and y represent the order with respect\nto the reactants A and B respectively.\nHence, the sum of powers of the concentration of the\nreactants in the rate law expression is called the order of that\nchemical reaction.\nOrder of a reaction can be 0, 1, 2, 3 and even a fraction. A zero\norder reaction means that the rate of reaction is independent of the\nconcentration of reactants.\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 33333.....33333 Calculate the overall order of a reaction which\nhas the rate expression\n(a) Rate = k [A]1/2 [B]3/2\n(b) Rate = k [A]3/2 [B]–1\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\n(a) Rate = k [A]x [B]y\norder = x + y\nSo order = 1/2 + 3/2 = 2, i.e., second order\n(b) order = 3/2 + (–1) = 1/2, i.e., half order.\nA balanced chemical equation never gives us a true picture of how\na reaction takes place since rarely a reaction gets completed in one\nstep. The reactions taking place in one step are called elementary\nreactions. When a sequence of elementary reactions (called mechanism)\ngives us the products, the reactions are called complex reactions.\nChemistry 68\nReprint 2025-26\nThese may be consecutive reactions (e.g., oxidation of ethane to CO\n2\nand H O passes through a series of intermediate steps in which alcohol,\n2\naldehyde and acid are formed), reverse reactions and side reactions\n(e.g., nitration of phenol yields o-nitrophenol and p-nitrophenol).\nUnits of rate constant\nFor a general reaction\naA + bB fi cC + dD\nRate = k [A]x [B]y\nWhere x + y = n = order of the reaction\nRate\nk =\n[A]x[B]y\n= concentration × 1 ( where [A]=[B] )\ntime ( concentration )n\nTaking SI units of concentration, mol L–1 and time, s, the units of\nk for different reaction order are listed in Table 3.3\nTable 3.3: Units of rate constant\nReaction Order Units of rate constant\nmolL- 1 1\n· =molL- 1s- 1\nZero order reaction 0 s ( molL- 1 )0\nmolL - 1 1\n· = s - 1\nFirst order reaction 1 s ( molL - 1 ) 1\nmolL - 1 1\n· = mol - 1Ls - 1\nSecond order reaction 2 s ( molL - 1 ) 2\nIdentify the reaction order from each of the following rate constants.

The number of reacting species\nReaction (atoms, ions or molecules) taking part in an elementary\nreaction, which must collide simultaneously in order to bring\nabout a chemical reaction is called molecularity of a reaction.\nThe reaction can be unimolecular when one reacting species is involved,\nfor example, decomposition of ammonium nitrite.\n69 Chemical Kinetics\nReprint 2025-26\nNH NO fi N + 2H O\n4 2 2 2\nBimolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision between two\nspecies, for example, dissociation of hydrogen iodide.\n2HI fi H + I\n2 2\nTrimolecular or termolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision\nbetween three reacting species, for example,\n2NO + O fi 2NO\n2 2\nThe probability that more than three molecules can collide and\nreact simultaneously is very small. Hence, reactions with the\nmolecularity three are very rare and slow to proceed.\nIt is, therefore, evident that complex reactions involving more than\nthree molecules in the stoichiometric equation must take place in more\nthan one step.\nKClO + 6FeSO + 3H SO fi KCl + 3Fe (SO ) + 3H O\n3 4 2 4 2 4 3 2\nThis reaction which apparently seems to be of tenth order is actually\na second order reaction. This shows that this reaction takes place in\nseveral steps. Which step controls the rate of the overall reaction? The\nquestion can be answered if we go through the mechanism of reaction,\nfor example, chances to win the relay race competition by a team\ndepend upon the slowest person in the team. Similarly, the overall rate\nof the reaction is controlled by the slowest step in a reaction called the\nrate determining step. Consider the decomposition of hydrogen\nperoxide which is catalysed by iodide ion in an alkaline medium.\nI-\n2H O  2H O + O\n2 2 Alkaline medium 2 2\nThe rate equation for this reaction is found to be\ndH O \nRate  2 2 kH O  I\ndt 2 2\nThis reaction is first order with respect to both H O and I–. Evidences\n2 2\nsuggest that this reaction takes place in two steps\n(1) H O + I– fi H O + IO–\n2 2 2\n(2) H O + IO– fi H O + I– + O\n2 2 2 2\nBoth the steps are bimolecular elementary reactions. Species IO- is\ncalled as an intermediate since it is formed during the course of the\nreaction but not in the overall balanced equation. The first step, being\nslow, is the rate determining step. Thus, the rate of formation of\nintermediate will determine the rate of this reaction.\nThus, from the discussion, till now, we conclude the following:\n(i) Order of a reaction is an experimental quantity. It can be zero and\neven a fraction but molecularity cannot be zero or a non integer.\n(ii) Order is applicable to elementary as well as complex reactions\nwhereas molecularity is applicable only for elementary reactions.\nFor complex reaction molecularity has no meaning.\nChemistry 70\nReprint 2025-26\n(iii) For complex reaction, order is given by the slowest step and\nmolecularity of the slowest step is same as the order of the overall\nreaction.\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n3.3 For a reaction, A + B fi Product; the rate law is given by, r = k [ A]1/2 [B]2.\nWhat is the order of the reaction?\n3.4 The conversion of molecules X to Y follows second order kinetics.

This makes it difficult to determine the rate law and hence\nthe order of the reaction. In order to avoid this difficulty, we can\nintegrate the differential rate equation to give a relation between directly\nmeasured experimental data, i.e., concentrations at different times\nand rate constant.\nThe integrated rate equations are different for the reactions of different\nreaction orders. We shall determine these equations only for zero and\nfirst order chemical reactions.\n3.3.1 Zero Order Zero order reaction means that the rate of the reaction is proportional\nReactions to zero power of the concentration of reactants.

The thermal decomposition of HI on gold surface\nis another example of zero order reaction.\n3.3.2 First Order In this class of reactions, the rate of the reaction is proportional to the\nReactions first power of the concentration of the reactant R.

Reaction\ncoordinate represents the profile of energy\nchange when reactants change into\nproducts.\nSome energy is released when the\ncomplex decomposes to form products.\nSo, the final enthalpy of the reaction\ndepends upon the nature of reactants\nand products.\nAll the molecules in the reacting\nspecies do not have the same kinetic\nFig. 3.7: Diagram showing plot of potential\nenergy. Since it is difficult to predict the energy vs reaction coordinate\nbehaviour of any one molecule with\nprecision, Ludwig Boltzmann and James\nClark Maxwell used statistics to predict\nthe behaviour of large number of\nmolecules. According to them, the\ndistribution of kinetic energy may be\ndescribed by plotting the fraction of\nmolecules (N /N ) with a given kinetic\nE T\nenergy (E) vs kinetic energy (Fig. 3.8).\nHere, N is the number of molecules with\nE\nenergy E and N is total number\nT\nof molecules.\nThe peak of the curve corresponds to\nthe most probable kinetic energy, i.e.,\nkinetic energy of maximum fraction of\nmolecules. There are decreasing number\nFig. 3.8: Distribution curve showing energies\nof molecules with energies higher or\namong gaseous molecules\nlower than this value. When the\n79 Chemical Kinetics\nReprint 2025-26\ntemperature is raised, the maximum\nof the curve moves to the higher\nenergy value (Fig. 3.9) and the curve\nbroadens out, i.e., spreads to the right\nsuch that there is a greater proportion\nof molecules with much higher\nenergies.

The substance is then called inhibitor. The\naction of the catalyst can be explained by intermediate complex theory.\nAccording to this theory, a catalyst participates in a chemical reaction by\nforming temporary bonds with the reactants resulting in an intermediate\ncomplex. This has a transitory existence and decomposes to yield products\nand the catalyst.\nIt is believed that the catalyst provides an\nalternate pathway or reaction mechanism by\nreducing the activation energy between\nreactants and products and hence lowering\nthe potential energy barrier as shown in\nFig. 3.11.\nIt is clear from Arrhenius equation (3.18)\nthat lower the value of activation energy faster\nwill be the rate of a reaction.\nA small amount of the catalyst can catalyse\na large amount of reactants. A catalyst does\nFig. 3.11:Effect of catalyst on activation\nenergy not alter Gibbs energy, DG of a reaction. It\ncatalyses the spontaneous reactions but does\nnot catalyse non-spontaneous reactions. It is\nalso found that a catalyst does not change the equilibrium constant of\na reaction rather, it helps in attaining the equilibrium faster, that is, it\ncatalyses the forward as well as the backward reactions to the same\nextent so that the equilibrium state remains same but is reached earlier.\n33333.....55555 CCCCCooooolllllllllliiiiisssssiiiiiooooonnnnn\nThough Arrhenius equation is applicable under a wide range of\nTTTTThhhhheeeeeooooorrrrryyyyy ooooofffff circumstances, collision theory, which was developed by Max Trautz\nand William Lewis in 1916 -18, provides a greater insight into the\nCCCCChhhhheeeeemmmmmiiiiicccccaaaaalllll\nenergetic and mechanistic aspects of reactions.

According to this theory, the reactant molecules are\nChemistry 82\nReprint 2025-26\nassumed to be hard spheres and reaction is postulated to occur when\nmolecules collide with each other. The number of collisions per\nsecond per unit volume of the reaction mixture is known as\ncollision frequency (Z). Another factor which affects the rate of\nchemical reactions is activation energy (as we have already studied).\nFor a bimolecular elementary reaction\nA + B fi Products\nrate of reaction can be expressed as\nRate = Z e - Ea/RT (3.23)\nAB\nwhere Z represents the collision frequency of reactants, A and B\nAB\nand e-Ea /RT represents the fraction of molecules with energies equal to\nor greater than E . Comparing (3.23) with Arrhenius equation, we can\na\nsay that A is related to collision frequency.\nEquation (3.23) predicts the value of rate constants fairly\naccurately for the reactions that involve atomic species or simple\nmolecules but for complex molecules significant deviations are\nobserved. The reason could be that all collisions do not lead to the\nformation of products. The collisions in which molecules collide with\nsufficient kinetic energy (called threshold energy*) and proper\norientation, so as to facilitate breaking of bonds between reacting\nspecies and formation of new bonds to form products are called as\neffective collisions.\nFor example, formation of\nmethanol from bromoethane depends\nupon the orientation of reactant\nmolecules as shown in\nFig. 3.12. The proper orientation of\nreactant molecules lead to bond\nformation whereas improper\norientation makes them simply\nbounce back and no products are\nformed.\nFig. 3.12:Diagram showing molecules having proper and\nTo account for effective collisions, improper orientation\nanother factor P, called the probability\nor steric factor is introduced. It takes into account the fact that in a\ncollision, molecules must be properly oriented i.e.,\nRate = PZ e - Ea/RT\nAB\nThus, in collision theory activation energy and proper orientation of\nthe molecules together determine the criteria for an effective collision\nand hence the rate of a chemical reaction.\nCollision theory also has certain drawbacks as it considers atoms/\nmolecules to be hard spheres and ignores their structural aspect.

The rate of a reaction is concerned with decrease in concentration\nof reactants or increase in the concentration of products per unit time. It can\nbe expressed as instantaneous rate at a particular instant of time and average\nrate over a large interval of time. A number of factors such as temperature,\nconcentration of reactants, catalyst, affect the rate of a reaction. Mathematical\nrepresentation of rate of a reaction is given by rate law. It has to be determined\nexperimentally and cannot be predicted. Order of a reaction with respect to\na reactant is the power of its concentration which appears in the rate law\nequation. The order of a reaction is the sum of all such powers of concentration\nof terms for different reactants. Rate constant is the proportionality factor in\nthe rate law. Rate constant and order of a reaction can be determined from rate\nlaw or its integrated rate equation. Molecularity is defined only for an elementary\nreaction. Its values are limited from 1 to 3 whereas order can be 0, 1, 2, 3 or\neven a fraction. Molecularity and order of an elementary reaction are same.\nTemperature dependence of rate constants is described by Arrhenius equation\n(k = Ae–Ea/RT). E corresponds to the activation energy and is given by the\na\nenergy difference between activated complex and the reactant molecules, and A\n(Arrhenius factor or pre-exponential factor) corresponds to the collision frequency.\nThe equation clearly shows that increase of temperature or lowering of E will\na\nlead to an increase in the rate of reaction and presence of a catalyst lowers the\nactivation energy by providing an alternate path for the reaction.

Zinc, cadmium and\nmercury of group 12 have full d10 configuration in their\nground state as well as in their common oxidation states\nand hence, are not regarded as transition metals.\nHowever, being the end members of the 3d, 4d and 5d\ntransition series, respectively, their chemistry is studied\nalong with the chemistry of the transition metals.\nThe presence of partly filled d or f orbitals in their\natoms makes transition elements different from that of\nReprint 2025-26\nthe non-transition elements. Hence, transition elements\nand their compounds are studied separately. However,\nthe usual theory of valence as applicable to the non-\ntransition elements can be applied successfully to the\ntransition elements also.\nVarious precious metals such as silver, gold and\nplatinum and industrially important metals like iron,\ncopper and titanium belong to the transition metals series.\nIn this Unit, we shall first deal with the electronic\nconfiguration, occurrence and general characteristics of\ntransition elements with special emphasis on the trends\nin the properties of the first row (3d) transition metals\nalong with the preparation and properties of some\nimportant compounds. This will be followed by\nconsideration of certain general aspects such as electronic\nconfigurations, oxidation states and chemical reactivity\nof the inner transition metals.\nTHE TRANSITION ELEMENTS (d-BLOCK)\n44444.....11111 PPPPPooooosssssiiiiitttttiiiiiooooonnnnn iiiiinnnnn ttttthhhhheeeee\nThe d–block occupies the large middle section of the periodic table\nPPPPPeeeeerrrrriiiiiooooodddddiiiiiccccc TTTTTaaaaabbbbbllllleeeee flanked between s– and p– blocks in the periodic table.

Furthermore,\nhalf and completely filled sets of orbitals are relatively more stable. A\nconsequence of this factor is reflected in the electronic configurations\nof Cr and Cu in the 3d series. For example, consider the case of Cr,\nwhich has 3d5 4s1 configuration instead of 3d44s2; the energy gap\nbetween the two sets (3d and 4s) of orbitals is small enough to prevent\nelectron entering the 3d orbitals. Similarly in case of Cu, the\nconfiguration is 3d104s1 and not 3d94s2. The ground state electronic\nconfigurations of the outer orbitals of transition elements are given in\nTable 4.1.\nTable 4.1: Electronic Configurations of outer orbitals of the Transition Elements\n(ground state)\n1st Series\nSc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zn\nZ 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\n4s 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 2\n3d 1 2 3 5 5 6 7 8 10 10\nChemistry 90\nReprint 2025-26\n2nd Series\nY Zr Nb Mo Tc Ru Rh Pd Ag Cd\nZ 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48\n5s 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 2\n4d 1 2 4 5 6 7 8 10 10 10\n3rd Series\nLa Hf Ta W Re Os Ir Pt Au Hg\nZ 57 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80\n6s 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 2\n5d 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 10\n4th Series\nAc Rf Db Sg Bh Hs Mt Ds Rg Cn\nZ 89 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112\n7s 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2\n6d 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 10\nThe electronic configurations of outer orbitals of Zn, Cd, Hg and Cn\nare represented by the general formula (n-1)d10ns2. The orbitals in\nthese elements are completely filled in the ground state as well as in\ntheir common oxidation states. Therefore, they are not regarded as\ntransition elements.\nThe d orbitals of the transition elements protrude to the periphery of\nan atom more than the other orbitals (i.e., s and p), hence, they are more\ninfluenced by the surroundings as well as affect the atoms or molecules\nsurrounding them. In some respects, ions of a given dn configuration\n(n = 1 – 9) have similar magnetic and electronic properties. With partly\nfilled d orbitals these elements exhibit certain characteristic properties\nsuch as display of a variety of oxidation states, formation of coloured\nions and entering into complex formation with a variety of ligands.\nThe transition metals and their compounds also exhibit catalytic\nproperty and paramagnetic behaviour. All these characteristics have\nbeen discussed in detail later in this Unit.\nThere are greater similarities in the properties of the transition\nelements of a horizontal row in contrast to the non-transition elements.\nHowever, some group similarities also exist. We shall first study the\ngeneral characteristics and their trends in the horizontal rows\n(particularly 3d row) and then consider some group similarities.\nOn what ground can you say that scandium (Z = 21) is a transition EEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 44444.....11111\nelement but zinc (Z = 30) is not?\nOn the basis of incompletely filled 3d orbitals in case of scandium atom SSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\nin its ground state (3d1), it is regarded as a transition element.

Their melting and boiling points are\nMo Os high. Fig. 4.1 depicts the melting points of\nNb Ru transition metals belonging to 3d, 4d and 5d\nIr\nseries. The high melting points of these metals\nHf Tc\nare attributed to the involvement of greater\nCr number of electrons from (n-1)d in addition to\nRh\nZr V Pt the ns electrons in the interatomic metallic\nTi Fe Co Pd bonding. In any row the melting points of these\nmetals rise to a maximum at d5 except for\nNi\nanomalous values of Mn and Tc and fall\nMn\nCu regularly as the atomic number increases.\nAu\nAg They have high enthalpies of atomisation which\nare shown in Fig. 4.2.

In general, greater the\nnumber of valence electrons, stronger is the resultant bonding. Since\nthe enthalpy of atomisation is an important factor in determining the\nstandard electrode potential of a metal, metals with very high enthalpy\nof atomisation (i.e., very high boiling point) tend to be noble in their\nreactions (see later for electrode potentials).\nAnother generalisation that may be drawn from Fig. 4.2 is that the\nmetals of the second and third series have greater enthalpies of\natomisation than the corresponding elements of the first series; this is an\nimportant factor in accounting for the occurrence of much more frequent\nmetal – metal bonding in compounds of the heavy transition metals.\nFig. 4.2\nTrends in enthalpies\nof atomisation of\ntransition elements\n4.3.2 Variation in In general, ions of the same charge in a given series show progressive\nAtomic and decrease in radius with increasing atomic number. This is because the\nIonic Sizes new electron enters a d orbital each time the nuclear charge increases\nof by unity. It may be recalled that the shielding effect of a d electron is\nTransition not that effective, hence the net electrostatic attraction between the\nMetals nuclear charge and the outermost electron increases and the ionic\nradius decreases. The same trend is observed in the atomic radii of a\ngiven series. However, the variation within a series is quite small. An\ninteresting point emerges when atomic sizes of one series are compared\nwith those of the corresponding elements in the other series. The curves\nin Fig. 4.3 show an increase from the first (3d) to the second (4d) series\nof the elements but the radii of the third (5d) series are virtually the\nsame as those of the corresponding members of the second series. This\nphenomenon is associated with the intervention of the 4f orbitals which\nmust be filled before the 5d series of elements begin. The filling of 4f\nbefore 5d orbital results in a regular decrease in atomic radii called\nLanthanoid contraction which essentially compensates for the expected\n93 The d- and f- Block Elements\n1–lom\nJk/VHD\na\nReprint 2025-26\nincrease in atomic size with increasing atomic number. The net result\nof the lanthanoid contraction is that the second and the third d series\nexhibit similar radii (e.g., Zr 160 pm, Hf 159 pm) and have very similar\nphysical and chemical properties much more than that expected on\nthe basis of usual family relationship.\n19 The factor responsible for the lanthanoid\ncontraction is somewhat similar to that observed\n18\nin an ordinary transition series and is attributed\nto similar cause, i.e., the imperfect shielding of\n16 one electron by another in the same set of orbitals.\nHowever, the shielding of one 4f electron by\n15\nanother is less than that of one d electron by\nanother, and as the nuclear charge increases\nalong the series, there is fairly regular decrease\n13\nin the size of the entire 4f n orbitals.\n12\nSc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zn The decrease in metallic radius coupled with\nY Zr Nb Mo Tc Ru Rh Pd Ag Cd increase in atomic mass results in a general\nincrease in the density of these elements.

Why?\n4.3.3 Ionisation There is an increase in ionisation enthalpy along each series of the\nEnthalpies transition elements from left to right due to an increase in nuclear\ncharge which accompanies the filling of the inner d orbitals. Table\n4.2 gives the values of the first three ionisation enthalpies of the first\nseries of transition elements. These values show that the successive\nenthalpies of these elements do not increase as steeply as in the case\nof non-transition elements. The variation in ionisation enthalpy along\na series of transition elements is much less in comparison to the variation\nalong a period of non-transition elements. The first ionisation enthalpy,\nin general, increases, but the magnitude of the increase in the second\nand third ionisation enthalpies for the successive elements, is much\nhigher along a series.\nThe irregular trend in the first ionisation enthalpy of the metals of\n3d series, though of little chemical significance, can be accounted for\nby considering that the removal of one electron alters the relative energies\nof 4s and 3d orbitals. You have learnt that when d-block elements form\nions, ns electrons are lost before (n – 1) d electrons. As we move along\nthe period in 3d series, we see that nuclear charge increases from\nscandium to zinc but electrons are added to the orbital of inner subshell,\ni.e., 3d orbitals. These 3d electrons shield the 4s electrons from the\nincreasing nuclear charge somewhat more effectively than the outer\nshell electrons can shield one another. Therefore, the atomic radii\ndecrease less rapidly. Thus, ionization energies increase only slightly\nalong the 3d series. The doubly or more highly charged ions have dn\nconfigurations with no 4s electrons. A general trend of increasing values\nof second ionisation enthalpy is expected as the effective nuclear charge\nincreases because one d electron does not shield another electron from\nthe influence of nuclear charge because d-orbitals differ in direction.\nHowever, the trend of steady increase in second and third ionisation\nenthalpy breaks for the formation of Mn2+ and Fe3+ respectively. In both\nthe cases, ions have d5 configuration. Similar breaks occur at\ncorresponding elements in the later transition series.\nThe interpretation of variation in ionisation enthalpy for an electronic\nconfiguration dn is as follows:\nThe three terms responsible for the value of ionisation enthalpy are\nattraction of each electron towards nucleus, repulsion between the\n95 The d- and f- Block Elements\nReprint 2025-26\nelectrons and the exchange energy. Exchange energy is responsible for\nthe stabilisation of energy state. Exchange energy is approximately\nproportional to the total number of possible pairs of parallel spins in\nthe degenerate orbitals. When several electrons occupy a set of\ndegenerate orbitals, the lowest energy state corresponds to the maximum\npossible extent of single occupation of orbital and parallel spins (Hunds\nrule). The loss of exchange energy increases the stability. As the stability\nincreases, the ionisation becomes more difficult. There is no loss of\nexchange energy at d6 configuration. Mn+ has 3d54s1 configuration and\nconfiguration of Cr+ is d5, therefore, ionisation enthalpy of Mn+ is lower\nthan Cr+. In the same way, Fe2+ has d6 configuration and Mn2+ has 3d5\nconfiguration. Hence, ionisation enthalpy of Fe2+ is lower than the Mn2+.\nIn other words, we can say that the third ionisation enthalpy of Fe is\nlower than that of Mn.\nThe lowest common oxidation state of these metals is +2. To\nform the M2+ ions from the gaseous atoms, the sum of the first and\nsecond ionisation enthalpy is required in addition to the enthalpy of\natomisation. The dominant term is the second ionisation enthalpy\nwhich shows unusually high values for Cr and Cu where M+ ions\nhave the d5 and d10 configurations respectively. The value for Zn is\ncorrespondingly low as the ionisation causes the removal of one 4s\nelectron which results in the formation of stable d10 configuration.\nThe trend in the third ionisation enthalpies is not complicated by\nthe 4s orbital factor and shows the greater difficulty of removing an\nelectron from the d5 (Mn2+) and d10 (Zn2+) ions. In general, the third\nionisation enthalpies are quite high. Also the high values for third\nionisation enthalpies of copper, nickel and zinc indicate why it is\ndifficult to obtain oxidation state greater than two for these elements.\nAlthough ionisation enthalpies give some guidance concerning the\nrelative stabilities of oxidation states, this problem is very complex and\nnot amenable to ready generalisation.\n4.3.4 Oxidation One of the notable features of a transition elements is the great variety\nStates of oxidation states these may show in their compounds. Table 4.3 lists\nthe common oxidation states of the first row transition elements.\nTable 4.3: Oxidation States of the first row Transition Metal\n(the most common ones are in bold types)\nSc Ti V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zn\n+2 +2 +2 +2 +2 +2 +2 +1 +2\n+3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +2\n+4 +4 +4 +4 +4 +4 +4\n+5 +5 +5\n+6 +6 +6\n+7\nChemistry 96\nReprint 2025-26\nThe elements which give the greatest number of oxidation states\noccur in or near the middle of the series. Manganese, for example,\nexhibits all the oxidation states from +2 to +7. The lesser number of\noxidation states at the extreme ends stems from either too few electrons\nto lose or share (Sc, Ti) or too many d electrons (hence fewer orbitals\navailable in which to share electrons with others) for higher valence\n(Cu, Zn). Thus, early in the series scandium(II) is virtually unknown\nand titanium (IV) is more stable than Ti(III) or Ti(II). At the other end,\nthe only oxidation state of zinc is +2 (no d electrons are involved). The\nmaximum oxidation states of reasonable stability correspond in value\nto the sum of the s and d electrons upto manganese (TiIVO , VVO +,\n2 2\nCrV1O 2–, MnVIIO –) followed by a rather abrupt decrease in stability of\n4 4\nhigher oxidation states, so that the typical species to follow are FeII,III,\nCoII,III, NiII, CuI,II, ZnII.\nThe variability of oxidation states, a characteristic of transition\nelements, arises out of incomplete filling of d orbitals in such a way\nthat their oxidation states differ from each other by unity, e.g., VII, VIII,\nVIV, VV. This is in contrast with the variability of oxidation states of non\ntransition elements where oxidation states normally differ by a unit\nof two.\nAn interesting feature in the variability of oxidation states of the d–\nblock elements is noticed among the groups (groups 4 through 10).\nAlthough in the p–block the lower oxidation states are favoured by the\nheavier members (due to inert pair effect), the opposite is true in the\ngroups of d-block. For example, in group 6, Mo(VI) and W(VI) are\nfound to be more stable than Cr(VI). Thus Cr(VI) in the form of dichromate\nin acidic medium is a strong oxidising agent, whereas MoO and WO\n3 3\nare not.\nLow oxidation states are found when a complex compound has\nligands capable of p-acceptor character in addition to the s-bonding.\nFor example, in Ni(CO) and Fe(CO) , the oxidation state of nickel and\n4 5\niron is zero.\nName a transition element which does not exhibit variable EEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 44444.....33333\noxidation states.\nScandium (Z = 21) does not exhibit variable oxidation states.\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\n4.3 Which of the 3d series of the transition metals exhibits the\nlargest number of oxidation states and why?\n97 The d- and f- Block Elements\nReprint 2025-26\n4.3.5 Trends in the Table 4.4 contains the thermochemical parameters related to the\nM2+/M transformation of the solid metal atoms to M2+ ions in solution and their\nV\nStandard standard electrode potentials.

The general trend towards less negative E values across the\nFig. 4.4:Observed and calculated values for the standard\nelectrode potentials\n(M2+ fi M°) of the elements Ti to Zn\nseries is related to the general increase in the sum of the first and second\nV\nionisation enthalpies.

The highest oxidation number in the oxides\n(Table 4.6) coincides with the group number and is attained in Sc O\n2 3\nto Mn O .

Many of\nReactivity them are sufficiently electropositive to dissolve in mineral acids, although\nand Eo a few are ‘noble’—that is, they are unaffected by single acids.\nValues The metals of the first series with the exception of copper are relatively\nmore reactive and are oxidised by 1M H+, though the actual rate at\nwhich these metals react with oxidising agents like hydrogen ion (H+) is\nsometimes slow. For example, titanium and vanadium, in practice, are\npassive to dilute non oxidising acids at room temperature. The Eo values\nfor M2+/M (Table 4.2) indicate a decreasing tendency to form divalent\ncations across the series. This general trend towards less negative Eo\nvalues is related to the increase in the sum of the first and second\nionisation enthalpies. It is interesting to note that the Eo values for Mn,\nNi and Zn are more negative than expected from the general trend.\nWhereas the stabilities of half-filled d subshell (d5) in Mn2+ and completely\nfilled d subshell (d10) in zinc are related to their E e values; for nickel, Eo\nvalue is related to the highest negative enthalpy of hydration.\nAn examination of the Eo values for the redox couple M3+/M2+ (Table\n4.2) shows that Mn3+ and Co3+ ions are the strongest oxidising agents\nin aqueous solutions.

Substances which are\n101 The d- and f- Block Elements\nReprint 2025-26\nattracted very strongly are said to be ferromagnetic. In fact,\nferromagnetism is an extreme form of paramagnetism. Many of the\ntransition metal ions are paramagnetic.\nParamagnetism arises from the presence of unpaired electrons, each\nsuch electron having a magnetic moment associated with its spin angular\nmomentum and orbital angular momentum. For the compounds of the\nfirst series of transition metals, the contribution of the orbital angular\nmomentum is effectively quenched and hence is of no significance. For\nthese, the magnetic moment is determined by the number of unpaired\nelectrons and is calculated by using the ‘spin-only’ formula, i.e.,\n  nn2\nwhere n is the number of unpaired electrons and µ is the magnetic\nmoment in units of Bohr magneton (BM). A single unpaired electron\nhas a magnetic moment of 1.73 Bohr magnetons (BM).\nThe magnetic moment increases with the increasing number of\nunpaired electrons. Thus, the observed magnetic moment gives a useful\nindication about the number of unpaired electrons present in the atom,\nmolecule or ion. The magnetic moments calculated from the ‘spin-only’\nformula and those derived experimentally for some ions of the first row\ntransition elements are given in Table 4.7. The experimental data are\nmainly for hydrated ions in solution or in the solid state.\nTable 4.7: Calculated and Observed Magnetic Moments (BM)\nIon Configuration Unpaired Magnetic moment\nelectron(s)\nCalculated Observed\nSc3+ 3d0 0 0 0\nTi3+ 3d1 1 1.73 1.75\nTl2+ 3d2 2 2.84 2.76\nV2+ 3d3 3 3.87 3.86\nCr2+ 3d4 4 4.90 4.80\nMn2+ 3d5 5 5.92 5.96\nFe2+ 3d6 4 4.90 5.3 – 5.5\nCo2+ 3d7 3 3.87 4.4 – 5.2\nNi2+ 3d8 2 2.84 2.9 – 3, 4\nCu2+ 3d9 1 1.73 1.8 – 2.2\nZn2+ 3d10 0 0\nCalculate the magnetic moment of a divalent ion in aqueous solution EEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 44444.....88888\nif its atomic number is 25.\nWith atomic number 25, the divalent ion in aqueous solution will have SSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\nd5 configuration (five unpaired electrons).

(The chemistry of complex compounds is\n3 4 4\n103 The d- and f- Block Elements\nReprint 2025-26\ndealt with in detail in Unit 5). The transition metals form a large\nnumber of complex compounds. This is due to the comparatively\nsmaller sizes of the metal ions, their high ionic charges and the\navailability of d orbitals for bond formation.\n4.3.12 Catalytic The transition metals and their compounds are known for their catalytic\nProperties activity. This activity is ascribed to their ability to adopt multiple\noxidation states and to form complexes. Vanadium(V) oxide (in Contact\nProcess), finely divided iron (in Haber’s Process), and nickel (in Catalytic\nHydrogenation) are some of the examples. Catalysts at a solid surface\ninvolve the formation of bonds between reactant molecules and atoms\nof the surface of the catalyst (first row transition metals utilise 3d and\n4s electrons for bonding). This has the effect of increasing the\nconcentration of the reactants at the catalyst surface and also weakening\nof the bonds in the reacting molecules (the activation energy is lowering).\nAlso because the transition metal ions can change their oxidation states,\nthey become more effective as catalysts. For example, iron(III) catalyses\nthe reaction between iodide and persulphate ions.\n2 I– + S O 2– fi I + 2 SO 2–\n2 8 2 4\nAn explanation of this catalytic action can be given as:\n2 Fe3+ + 2 I– fi 2 Fe2+ + I\n2\n2 Fe2+ + S O 2– fi 2 Fe3+ + 2SO 2–\n2 8 4\n4.3.13 Formation Interstitial compounds are those which are formed when small atoms\nof like H, C or N are trapped inside the crystal lattices of metals. They are\nInterstitial usually non stoichiometric and are neither typically ionic nor covalent,\nCompounds for example, TiC, Mn N, Fe H, VH . and TiH , etc. The formulas\n4 3 0 56 1.7\nquoted do not, of course, correspond to any normal oxidation state of\nthe metal. Because of the nature of their composition, these compounds\nare referred to as interstitial compounds. The principal physical and\nchemical characteristics of these compounds are as follows:\n(i) They have high melting points, higher than those of pure metals.\n(ii) They are very hard, some borides approach diamond in hardness.\n(iii) They retain metallic conductivity.\n(iv) They are chemically inert.\n4.3.14 Alloy An alloy is a blend of metals prepared by mixing the components.\nFormation Alloys may be homogeneous solid solutions in which the atoms of one\nmetal are distributed randomly among the atoms of the other. Such\nalloys are formed by atoms with metallic radii that are within about 15\npercent of each other. Because of similar radii and other characteristics\nof transition metals, alloys are readily formed by these metals. The\nalloys so formed are hard and have often high melting points. The best\nknown are ferrous alloys: chromium, vanadium, tungsten, molybdenum\nand manganese are used for the production of a variety of steels and\nstainless steel. Alloys of transition metals with non transition metals\nsuch as brass (copper-zinc) and bronze (copper-tin), are also of\nconsiderable industrial importance.\nChemistry 104\nReprint 2025-26\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 44444.....99999 What is meant by ‘disproportionation’ of an oxidation state?

In the case of Mn, Mn O is a covalent green oil. Even CrO\n2 7 3\nand V O have low melting points.

The green manganate is paramagnetic because of one\nunpaired electron but the permanganate is diamagnetic due to the\nabsence of unpaired electron.\nAcidified permanganate solution oxidises oxalates to carbon dioxide,\niron(II) to iron(III), nitrites to nitrates and iodides to free iodine.\nThe half-reactions of reductants are:\nCOO–\n5 10CO + 10e–\n2\nCOO–\n5 Fe2+ fi 5 Fe3+ + 5e–\n5NO – + 5H O fi 5NO – + 10H+ + l0e–\n2 2 3\n10I– fi 5I + 10e–\n2\nThe full reaction can be written by adding the half-reaction for\nKMnO to the half-reaction of the reducing agent, balancing wherever\n4\nnecessary.\nIf we represent the reduction of permanganate to manganate,\nmanganese dioxide and manganese(II) salt by half-reactions,\nMnO – + e– fi MnO 2– (Eo = + 0.56 V)\n4 4\nMnO – + 4H+ + 3e– fi MnO + 2H O (Eo = + 1.69 V)\n4 2 2\nMnO – + 8H+ + 5e– fi Mn2+ + 4H O (Eo = + 1.52 V)\n4 2\nWe can very well see that the hydrogen ion concentration of the\nsolution plays an important part in influencing the reaction. Although\nmany reactions can be understood by consideration of redox potential,\nkinetics of the reaction is also an important factor. Permanganate at\n[H+] = 1 should oxidise water but in practice the reaction is extremely slow\nunless either manganese(ll) ions are present or the temperature is raised.\nA few important oxidising reactions of KMnO are given below:\n4\n1.

Its uses for the\nbleaching of wool, cotton, silk and other textile fibres and for the decolourisation\nof oils are also dependent on its strong oxidising power.\nTHE INNER TRANSITION ELEMENTS ( f-BLOCK)\nThe f-block consists of the two series, lanthanoids (the fourteen elements\nfollowing lanthanum) and actinoids (the fourteen elements following\nactinium). Because lanthanum closely resembles the lanthanoids, it is\nusually included in any discussion of the lanthanoids for which the\ngeneral symbol Ln is often used. Similarly, a discussion of the actinoids\nincludes actinium besides the fourteen elements constituting the series.\nThe lanthanoids resemble one another more closely than do the members\nof ordinary transition elements in any series. They have only one stable\noxidation state and their chemistry provides an excellent opportunity to\nexamine the effect of small changes in size and nuclear charge along a\nseries of otherwise similar elements. The chemistry of the actinoids is, on\nthe other hand, much more complicated. The complication arises partly\nowing to the occurrence of a wide range of oxidation states in these\nelements and partly because their radioactivity creates special problems\nin their study; the two series will be considered separately here.\n44444.....55555 TTTTThhhhheeeee\nThe names, symbols, electronic configurations of atomic and some\nLLLLLaaaaannnnnttttthhhhhaaaaannnnnoooooiiiiidddddsssss ionic states and atomic and ionic radii of lanthanum and lanthanoids\n(for which the general symbol Ln is used) are given in Table 4.9.\nChemistry 108\nReprint 2025-26\nSm2\n110\nEu2+\nLa3+\nCe3+\nPr3+\n100 Nd3+\nPm3+\nSm3+\nEu3+\nGd3+ Tm2+\nCe4+ Tb3+\nYb2+\nDy3+\n90\nPr4+\nHo3+\nEr3+\nTm3+\nYb3+\nLu3+\nTb4+\n57 59 61 63 65 67 69 71\n109 The d- and f- Block Elements\nmp/iidar\ncinoI\n4.5.1 Electronic It may be noted that atoms of these elements have electronic\nConfigurations configuration with 6s2 common but with variable occupancy of 4f level\n(Table 4.9). However, the electronic configurations of all the tripositive\nions (the most stable oxidation state of all the lanthanoids) are of the\nform 4f n (n = 1 to 14 with increasing atomic number).\n4.5.2 Atomic and The overall decrease in atomic and ionic radii from lanthanum to\nIonic Sizes lutetium (the lanthanoid contraction) is a unique feature in the\nchemistry of the lanthanoids. It has far reaching\nconsequences in the chemistry of the third\n+\ntransition series of the elements. The decrease\nin atomic radii (derived from the structures of\nmetals) is not quite regular as it is regular in\nM3+ ions (Fig. 4.6). This contraction is, of\ncourse, similar to that observed in an ordinary\ntransition series and is attributed to the same\ncause, the imperfect shielding of one electron\nby another in the same sub-shell. However, the\nshielding of one 4 f electron by another is less\nthan one d electron by another with the increase\nin nuclear charge along the series. There is\nfairly regular decrease in the sizes with\nincreasing atomic number.\nThe cumulative effect of the contraction of\nthe lanthanoid series, known as lanthanoid\ncontraction, causes the radii of the members\nof the third transition series to be very similar\nto those of the corresponding members of the\nsecond series. The almost identical radii of Zr\n(160 pm) and Hf (159 pm), a consequence of\nthe lanthanoid contraction, account for their\nAtomic number\noccurrence together in nature and for the\nFig. 4.6: Trends in ionic radii of lanthanoids difficulty faced in their separation.\n4.5.3 Oxidation In the lanthanoids, La(II) and Ln(III) compounds are predominant\nStates species. However, occasionally +2 and +4 ions in solution or in solid\ncompounds are also obtained. This irregularity (as in ionisation\nenthalpies) arises mainly from the extra stability of empty, half-filled\nor filled f subshell. Thus, the formation of CeIV is favoured by its\nnoble gas configuration, but it is a strong oxidant reverting to the\ncommon +3 state. The Eo value for Ce4+/ Ce3+ is + 1.74 V which\nsuggests that it can oxidise water. However, the reaction rate is very\nslow and hence Ce(IV) is a good analytical reagent. Pr, Nd, Tb and Dy\nalso exhibit +4 state but only in oxides, MO . Eu2+ is formed by losing\n2\nthe two s electrons and its f 7 configuration accounts for the formation\nof this ion. However, Eu2+ is a strong reducing agent changing to the\ncommon +3 state. Similarly Yb2+ which has f 14 configuration is a\nreductant. TbIV has half-filled f-orbitals and is an oxidant. The\nbehaviour of samarium is very much like europium, exhibiting both\n+2 and +3 oxidation states.\nReprint 2025-26\nTable 4.9: Electronic Configurations and Radii of Lanthanum and Lanthanoids\nElectronic configurations* Radii/pm\nAtomic Name Symbol Ln Ln2+ Ln3+ Ln4+ Ln Ln3+\nNumber\n57 Lanthanum La 5d16s2 5d1 4f 0 187 106\n58 Cerium Ce 4f15d16s2 4f 2 4f 1 4f 0 183 103\n59 Praseodymium Pr 4f 36s2 4f 3 4f 2 4f 1 182 101\n60 Neodymium Nd 4f 46s2 4f 4 4f 3 4f 2 181 99\n61 Promethium Pm 4f 56s2 4f 5 4f 4 181 98\n62 Samarium Sm 4f 66s2 4f 6 4f 5 180 96\n63 Europium Eu 4f 76s2 4f 7 4f 6 199 95\n64 Gadolinium Gd 4f 75d16s2 4f 75d1 4f 7 180 94\n65 Terbium Tb 4f 96s2 4f 9 4f 8 4f 7 178 92\n66 Dysprosium Dy 4f 106s2 4f 10 4f 9 4f 8 177 91\n67 Holmium Ho 4f 116s2 4f 11 4f 10 176 89\n68 Erbium Er 4f 126s2 4f 12 4f 11 175 88\n69 Thulium Tm 4f 136s2 4f 13 4f 12 174 87\n70 Ytterbium Yb 4f 146s2 4f 14 4f 13 173 86\n71 Lutetium Lu 4f 145d16s2 4f 145d1 4f 14 – – –\n* Only electrons outside [Xe] core are indicated\n4.5.4 General All the lanthanoids are silvery white soft metals and tarnish rapidly in air.\nCharacteristics The hardness increases with increasing atomic number, samarium being\nsteel hard. Their melting points range between 1000 to 1200 K but\nsamarium melts at 1623 K. They have typical metallic structure and are\ngood conductors of heat and electricity. Density and other properties\nchange smoothly except for Eu and Yb and occasionally for Sm and Tm.\nMany trivalent lanthanoid ions are coloured both in the solid state\nand in aqueous solutions. Colour of these ions may be attributed to\nthe presence of f electrons. Neither La3+ nor Lu3+ ion shows any colour\nbut the rest do so. However, absorption bands are narrow, probably\nbecause of the excitation within f level. The lanthanoid ions other\nthan the f 0 type (La3+ and Ce4+) and the f 14 type (Yb2+ and Lu3+) are\nall paramagnetic.\nThe first ionisation enthalpies of the lanthanoids are around\n600 kJ mol–1, the second about 1200 kJ mol–1 comparable with those\nof calcium. A detailed discussion of the variation of the third ionisation\nenthalpies indicates that the exchange enthalpy considerations (as in\n3d orbitals of the first transition series), appear to impart a certain\ndegree of stability to empty, half-filled and completely filled orbitals\nf level. This is indicated from the abnormally low value of the third\nionisation enthalpy of lanthanum, gadolinium and lutetium.\nIn their chemical behaviour, in general, the earlier members of the series\nare quite reactive similar to calcium but, with increasing atomic number,\nthey behave more like aluminium.

A\nwell known alloy is mischmetall which consists of a lanthanoid metal\n(~ 95%) and iron (~ 5%) and traces of S, C, Ca and Al. A good deal of\nmischmetall is used in Mg-based alloy to produce bullets, shell and\nlighter flint. Mixed oxides of lanthanoids are employed as catalysts in\npetroleum cracking. Some individual Ln oxides are used as phosphors\nin television screens and similar fluorescing surfaces.\n44444.....66666 TTTTThhhhheeeee AAAAAccccctttttiiiiinnnnnoooooiiiiidddddsssss\nThe actinoids include the fourteen elements from Th to Lr.

The latter members could be\nprepared only in nanogram quantities. These facts render their study\nmore difficult.\n4.6.1 Electronic All the actinoids are believed to have the electronic configuration of 7s2\nConfigurations and variable occupancy of the 5f and 6d subshells. The fourteen electrons\nare formally added to 5f, though not in thorium (Z = 90) but from Pa\nonwards the 5f orbitals are complete at element 103. The irregularities in\nthe electronic configurations of the actinoids, like those in the lanthanoids\nare related to the stabilities of the f 0, f 7 and f 14 occupancies of the 5f\norbitals. Thus, the configurations of Am and Cm are [Rn] 5f 77s2 and\n[Rn] 5f 76d17s2. Although the 5f orbitals resemble the 4f orbitals in their\nangular part of the wave-function, they are not as buried as 4f orbitals\nand hence 5f electrons can participate in bonding to a far greater extent.\n4.6.2 Ionic Sizes The general trend in lanthanoids is observable in the actinoids as well.\nThere is a gradual decrease in the size of atoms or M3+ ions across the\nseries. This may be referred to as the actinoid contraction (like lanthanoid\ncontraction). The contraction is, however, greater from element to element\nin this series resulting from poor shielding by 5f electrons.\n4.6.3 Oxidation There is a greater range of oxidation states, which is in part attributed to\nStates the fact that the 5f, 6d and 7s levels are of comparable energies. The\nknown oxidation states of actinoids are listed in Table 4.11.\nThe actinoids show in general +3 oxidation state. The elements, in the\nfirst half of the series frequently exhibit higher oxidation states. For example,\nthe maximum oxidation state increases from +4 in Th to +5, +6 and +7\nrespectively in Pa, U and Np but decreases in succeeding elements (Table\n4.11). The actinoids resemble the lanthanoids in having more compounds\nin +3 state than in the +4 state. However, +3 and +4 ions tend to hydrolyse.\nBecause the distribution of oxidation states among the actinoids is so\nuneven and so different for the former and later elements, it is unsatisfactory\nto review their chemistry in terms of oxidation states.\nTable 4.11: Oxidation States of Actinium and Actinoids\nAc Th Pa U Np Pu Am Cm Bk Cf Es Fm Md No Lr\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n5 5 5 5 5\n6 6 6 6\n7 7\n4.6.4 General The actinoid metals are all silvery in appearance but display\nCharacteristics a variety of structures. The structural variability is obtained\nand Comparison due to irregularities in metallic radii which are far greater\nwith Lanthanoids than in lanthanoids.\nChemistry 112\nReprint 2025-26\nThe actinoids are highly reactive metals, especially when finely divided.\nThe action of boiling water on them, for example, gives a mixture of oxide\nand hydride and combination with most non metals takes place at\nmoderate temperatures. Hydrochloric acid attacks all metals but most are\nslightly affected by nitric acid owing to the formation of protective oxide\nlayers; alkalies have no action.\nThe magnetic properties of the actinoids are more complex than those\nof the lanthanoids. Although the variation in the magnetic susceptibility\nof the actinoids with the number of unpaired 5 f electrons is roughly\nparallel to the corresponding results for the lanthanoids, the latter have\nhigher values.\nIt is evident from the behaviour of the actinoids that the ionisation\nenthalpies of the early actinoids, though not accurately known, but are\nlower than for the early lanthanoids. This is quite reasonable since it is to\nbe expected that when 5f orbitals are beginning to be occupied, they will\npenetrate less into the inner core of electrons. The 5f electrons, will therefore,\nbe more effectively shielded from the nuclear charge than the 4f electrons\nof the corresponding lanthanoids. Because the outer electrons are less\nfirmly held, they are available for bonding in the actinoids.\nA comparison of the actinoids with the lanthanoids, with respect to\ndifferent characteristics as discussed above, reveals that behaviour similar\nto that of the lanthanoids is not evident until the second half of the\nactinoid series. However, even the early actinoids resemble the lanthanoids\nin showing close similarities with each other and in gradual variation in\nproperties which do not entail change in oxidation state. The lanthanoid\nand actinoid contractions, have extended effects on the sizes, and\ntherefore, the properties of the elements succeeding them in their\nrespective periods. The lanthanoid contraction is more important because\nthe chemistry of elements succeeding the actinoids are much less known\nat the present time.\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 44444.....1111100000\nName a member of the lanthanoid series which is well known\nto exhibit +4 oxidation state.\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn Cerium (Z = 58)\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\n4.10 Actinoid contraction is greater from element to element than\nlanthanoid contraction.

The ‘silver’ UK coins are a Cu/Ni alloy. Many of\nthe metals and/or their compounds are essential catalysts in the chemical\nindustry. V O catalyses the oxidation of SO in the manufacture of\n2 5 2\nsulphuric acid. TiCl with A1(CH ) forms the basis of the Ziegler catalysts\n4 33\nused to manufacture polyethylene (polythene). Iron catalysts are used in\nthe Haber process for the production of ammonia from N /H mixtures.\n2 2\nNickel catalysts enable the hydrogenation of fats to proceed. In the Wacker\nprocess the oxidation of ethyne to ethanal is catalysed by PdCl . Nickel\n2\ncomplexes are useful in the polymerisation of alkynes and other organic\ncompounds such as benzene. The photographic industry relies on the\nspecial light-sensitive properties of AgBr.\nSSSSSuuuuummmmmmmmmmaaaaarrrrryyyyy\nThe d-block consisting of Groups 3-12 occupies the large middle section of the periodic\ntable. In these elements the inner d orbitals are progressively filled. The f-block is placed\noutside at the bottom of the periodic table and in the elements of this block, 4f and\n5f orbitals are progressively filled.\nCorresponding to the filling of 3d, 4d and 5d orbitals, three series of transition\nelements are well recognised. All the transition elements exhibit typical metallic properties\nsuch as –high tensile strength, ductility, malleability, thermal and electrical conductivity\nand metallic character. Their melting and boiling points are high which are attributed\nto the involvement of (n–1)d electrons resulting into strong interatomic bonding. In\nmany of these properties, the maxima occur at about the middle of each series which\nindicates that one unpaired electron per d orbital is particularly a favourable configuration\nfor strong interatomic interaction.\nSuccessive ionisation enthalpies do not increase as steeply as in the main group\nelements with increasing atomic number. Hence, the loss of variable number of electrons\nfrom (n–1)d orbitals is not energetically unfavourable. The involvement of (n–1)d electrons\nin the behaviour of transition elements impart certain distinct characteristics to these\nelements. Thus, in addition to variable oxidation states, they exhibit paramagnetic\nbehaviour, catalytic properties and tendency for the formation of coloured ions, interstitial\ncompounds and complexes.\nThe transition elements vary widely in their chemical behaviour. Many of them are\nsufficiently electropositive to dissolve in mineral acids, although a few are ‘noble’. Of the\nfirst series, with the exception of copper, all the metals are relatively reactive.\nThe transition metals react with a number of non-metals like oxygen, nitrogen,\nsulphur and halogens to form binary compounds. The first series transition metal oxides\nare generally formed from the reaction of metals with oxygen at high temperatures. These\noxides dissolve in acids and bases to form oxometallic salts. Potassium dichromate and\npotassium permanganate are common examples. Potassium dichromate is prepared from\nthe chromite ore by fusion with alkali in presence of air and acidifying the extract.\nPyrolusite ore (MnO ) is used for the preparation of potassium permanganate. Both the\n2\ndichromate and the permanganate ions are strong oxidising agents.\nThe two series of inner transition elements, lanthanoids and actinoids constitute\nthe f-block of the periodic table. With the successive filling of the inner orbitals, 4f, there\nis a gradual decrease in the atomic and ionic sizes of these metals along the series\n(lanthanoid contraction). This has far reaching consequences in the chemistry of the\nelements succeeding them. Lanthanum and all the lanthanoids are rather soft white\nmetals. They react easily with water to give solutions giving +3 ions. The principal\noxidation state is +3, although +4 and +2 oxidation states are also exhibited by some\nChemistry 114\nReprint 2025-26\noccasionally. The chemistry of the actinoids is more complex in view of their ability to\nexist in different oxidation states. Furthermore, many of the actinoid elements are radioactive\nwhich make the study of these elements rather difficult.\nThere are many useful applications of the d- and f-block elements and their\ncompounds, notable among them being in varieties of steels, catalysts, complexes,\norganic syntheses, etc.\nExercises\n4.1 Write down the electronic configuration of:\n(i) Cr3+ (iii) Cu+ (v) Co2+ (vii) Mn2+\n(ii) Pm3+ (iv) Ce4+ (vi) Lu2+ (viii) Th4+\n4.2 Why are Mn2+ compounds more stable than Fe2+ towards oxidation to their\n+3 state?\n4.3 Explain briefly how +2 state becomes more and more stable in the first half\nof the first row transition elements with increasing atomic number?\n4.4 To what extent do the electronic configurations decide the stability of\noxidation states in the first series of the transition elements?

Werner proposed the concept of a primary valence and\na secondary valence for a metal ion. Binary compounds such as\nCrCl , CoCl or PdCl have primary valence of 3, 2 and 2 respectively.\n3 2 2\nIn a series of compounds of cobalt(III) chloride with ammonia, it was\nfound that some of the chloride ions could be precipitated as AgCl on\nadding excess silver nitrate solution in cold but some remained in\nsolution.\nChemistry 118\nReprint 2025-26\n1 mol CoCl .6NH (Yellow) gave 3 mol AgCl\n3 3\n1 mol CoCl .5NH (Purple) gave 2 mol AgCl\n3 3\n1 mol CoCl .4NH (Green) gave 1 mol AgCl\n3 3\n1 mol CoCl .4NH (Violet) gave 1 mol AgCl\n3 3\nThese observations, together with the results of conductivity\nmeasurements in solution can be explained if (i) six groups in all,\neither chloride ions or ammonia molecules or both, remain bonded to\nthe cobalt ion during the reaction and (ii) the compounds are formulated\nas shown in Table 5.1, where the atoms within the square brackets\nform a single entity which does not dissociate under the reaction\nconditions. Werner proposed the term secondary valence for the\nnumber of groups bound directly to the metal ion; in each of these\nexamples the secondary valences are six.\nTable 5.1: Formulation of Cobalt(III) Chloride-Ammonia Complexes\nColour Formula Solution conductivity\ncorresponds to\nYellow [Co(NH ) ]3+3Cl– 1:3 electrolyte\n36\nPurple [CoCl(NH ) ]2+2Cl– 1:2 electrolyte\n3 5\nGreen [CoCl (NH ) ]+Cl– 1:1 electrolyte\n2 34\nViolet [CoCl (NH ) ]+Cl– 1:1 electrolyte\n2 34\nNote that the last two compounds in Table 5.1 have identical empirical\nformula, CoCl .4NH , but distinct properties. Such compounds are\n3 3\ntermed as isomers. Werner in 1898, propounded his theory of\ncoordination compounds. The main postulates are:\n1. In coordination compounds metals show two types of linkages\n(valences)-primary and secondary.\n2. The primary valences are normally ionisable and are satisfied by\nnegative ions.\n3. The secondary valences are non ionisable. These are satisfied by\nneutral molecules or negative ions. The secondary valence is equal to\nthe coordination number and is fixed for a metal.\n4. The ions/groups bound by the secondary linkages to the metal have\ncharacteristic spatial arrangements corresponding to different\ncoordination numbers.\nIn modern formulations, such spatial arrangements are called\ncoordination polyhedra. The species within the square bracket are\ncoordination entities or complexes and the ions outside the square\nbracket are called counter ions.\nHe further postulated that octahedral, tetrahedral and square planar\ngeometrical shapes are more common in coordination compounds of\ntransition metals. Thus, [Co(NH ) ]3+, [CoCl(NH ) ]2+ and [CoCl (NH ) ]+\n3 6 3 5 2 3 4\nare octahedral entities, while [Ni(CO) ] and [PtCl ]2– are tetrahedral and\n4 4\nsquare planar, respectively.\n119 Coordination Compounds\nReprint 2025-26\nOn the basis of the following observations made with aqueous solutions, EEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 55555.....11111\nassign secondary valences to metals in the following compounds:\nFormula Moles of AgCl precipitated per mole of\nthe compounds with excess AgNO\n3\n(i) PdCl .4NH 2\n2 3\n(ii) NiCl .6H O 2\n2 2\n(iii) PtCl .2HCl 0\n4\n(iv) CoCl .4NH 1\n3 3\n(v) PtCl .2NH 0\n2 3\n(i) Secondary 4 (ii) Secondary 6 SSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\n(iii) Secondary 6 (iv) Secondary 6 (v) Secondary 4\nDifference between a double salt and a complex\nBoth double salts as well as complexes are formed by the combination\nof two or more stable compounds in stoichiometric ratio.

He extended vant\nHoff’s theory of tetrahedral carbon atom and modified\nit for nitrogen. Werner showed optical and electrical differences between\ncomplex compounds based on physical measurements. In fact, Werner was\nthe first to discover optical activity in certain coordination compounds.\nHe, at the age of 29 years became a full professor at Technische\nHochschule in Zurich in 1895. Alfred Werner was a chemist and educationist.\nHis accomplishments included the development of the theory of coordination\ncompounds. This theory, in which Werner proposed revolutionary ideas about\nhow atoms and molecules are linked together, was formulated in a span of\nonly three years, from 1890 to 1893. The remainder of his career was spent\ngathering the experimental support required to validate his new ideas.

For example, the\ncentral atom/ion in the coordination entities: [NiCl (H O) ],\n2 2 4\n[CoCl(NH ) ]2+ and [Fe(CN) ]3– are Ni2+, Co3+ and Fe3+, respectively.\n3 5 6\nThese central atoms/ions are also referred to as Lewis acids.\n(c) Ligands\nThe ions or molecules bound to the central atom/ion in the\ncoordination entity are called ligands. These may be simple ions\nsuch as Cl–, small molecules such as H O or NH , larger molecules\n2 3\nsuch as H NCH CH NH or N(CH CH NH ) or even macromolecules,\n2 2 2 2 2 2 23\nsuch as proteins.\nWhen a ligand is bound to a metal ion through a single donor\natom, as with Cl–, H O or NH , the ligand is said to be unidentate.\n2 3\nWhen a ligand can bind through two donor atoms as in\nH NCH CH NH (ethane-1,2-diamine) or C O 2– (oxalate), the\n2 2 2 2 2 4\nligand is said to be didentate and when several donor atoms are\npresent in a single ligand as in N(CH CH NH ) , the ligand is said\n2 2 23\nto be polydentate. Ethylenediaminetetraacetate ion (EDTA4–) is\nan important hexadentate ligand. It can bind through two\nnitrogen and four oxygen atoms to a central metal ion.\nWhen a di- or polydentate ligand uses its two or more donor\natoms simultaneously to bind a single metal ion, it is said to be a\nchelate ligand. The number of such ligating groups is called the\ndenticity of the ligand. Such complexes, called chelate complexes\ntend to be more stable than similar complexes containing unidentate\nligands. Ligand which has two different donor atoms and either of\nthe two ligetes in the complex is called ambidentate\nligand. Examples of such ligands are the NO – and\n2\nSCN– ions. NO – ion can coordinate either through\n2\nnitrogen or through oxygen to a central metal\natom/ion.\nSimilarly, SCN– ion can coordinate through the\nsulphur or nitrogen atom.\n(d) Coordination number\nThe coordination number (CN) of a metal ion in a complex can be\ndefined as the number of ligand donor atoms to which the metal is\ndirectly bonded. For example, in the complex ions, [PtCl ]2– and\n6\n[Ni(NH ) ]2+, the coordination number of Pt and Ni are 6 and 4\n3 4\nrespectively. Similarly, in the complex ions, [Fe(C O ) ]3– and\n2 4 3\n[Co(en) ]3+, the coordination number of both, Fe and Co, is 6 because\n3\nC O 2– and en (ethane-1,2-diamine) are didentate ligands.\n2 4\n121 Coordination Compounds\nReprint 2025-26\nIt is important to note here that coordination number of the central\natom/ion is determined only by the number of sigma bonds formed by\nthe ligand with the central atom/ion. Pi bonds, if formed between the\nligand and the central atom/ion, are not counted for this purpose.\n(e) Coordination sphere\nThe central atom/ion and the ligands attached to it are enclosed in\nsquare bracket and is collectively termed as the coordination\nsphere. The ionisable groups are written outside the bracket and\nare called counter ions. For example, in the complex K [Fe(CN) ],\n4 6\nthe coordination sphere is [Fe(CN) ]4– and the counter ion is K+.\n6\n(f) Coordination polyhedron\nThe spatial arrangement of the ligand atoms which are directly\nattached to the central atom/ion defines a coordination\npolyhedron about the central atom. The most common\ncoordination polyhedra are octahedral, square planar and\ntetrahedral. For example, [Co(NH ) ]3+ is octahedral, [Ni(CO) ] is\n3 6 4\ntetrahedral and [PtCl ]2– is square planar. Fig. 5.1 shows the\n4\nshapes of different coordination polyhedra.\nFig. 5.1:Shapes of different coordination polyhedra. M\nrepresents the central atom/ion and L, a unidentate\nligand.\n(g) Oxidation number of central atom\nThe oxidation number of the central atom in a complex is defined\nas the charge it would carry if all the ligands are removed along\nwith the electron pairs that are shared with the central atom. The\noxidation number is represented by a Roman numeral in parenthesis\nfollowing the name of the coordination entity. For example, oxidation\nnumber of copper in [Cu(CN) ]3– is +1 and it is written as Cu(I).\n4\n(h)Homoleptic and heteroleptic complexes\nComplexes in which a metal is bound to only one kind of donor\ngroups, e.g., [Co(NH ) ]3+, are known as homoleptic. Complexes in\n3 6\nwhich a metal is bound to more than one kind of donor groups,\ne.g., [Co(NH ) Cl ]+, are known as heteroleptic.\n3 4 2\n55555.....33333 NNNNNooooommmmmeeeeennnnnccccclllllaaaaatttttuuuuurrrrreeeee Nomenclature is important in Coordination Chemistry because of the\nooooofffff need to have an unambiguous method of describing formulas and\nwriting systematic names, particularly when dealing with isomers. The\nCCCCCoooooooooorrrrrdddddiiiiinnnnnaaaaatttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\nformulas and names adopted for coordination entities are based on the\nCCCCCooooommmmmpppppooooouuuuunnnnndddddsssss recommendations of the International Union of Pure and Applied\nChemistry (IUPAC).\nChemistry 122\nReprint 2025-26\n5.3.1 Formulas of The formula of a compound is a shorthand tool used to provide basic\nMononuclear information about the constitution of the compound in a concise and\nCoordination convenient manner. Mononuclear coordination entities contain a single\nEntities central metal atom. The following rules are applied while writing the formulas:\n(i) The central atom is listed first.\n(ii) The ligands are then listed in alphabetical order. The placement of\na ligand in the list does not depend on its charge.\n(iii) Polydentate ligands are also listed alphabetically. In case of\nabbreviated ligand, the first letter of the abbreviation is used to\ndetermine the position of the ligand in the alphabetical order.\n(iv) The formula for the entire coordination entity, whether charged or\nnot, is enclosed in square brackets. When ligands are polyatomic,\ntheir formulas are enclosed in parentheses. Ligand abbreviations\nare also enclosed in parentheses.\n(v) There should be no space between the ligands and the metal\nwithin a coordination sphere.\n(vi) When the formula of a charged coordination entity is to be written\nNote: The 2004 IUPAC without that of the counter ion, the charge is indicated outside the\ndraft recommends that\nsquare brackets as a right superscript with the number before the\nligands will be sorted\nalphabetically, sign. For example, [Co(CN) 6 ]3–, [Cr(H 2 O) 6 ]3+, etc.\nirrespective of charge. (vii) The charge of the cation(s) is balanced by the charge of the anion(s).\n5.3.2 Naming of The names of coordination compounds are derived by following the\nMononuclear principles of additive nomenclature. Thus, the groups that surround the\nCoordination central atom must be identified in the name. They are listed as prefixes\nCompounds to the name of the central atom along with any appropriate multipliers.\nThe following rules are used when naming coordination compounds:\n(i) The cation is named first in both positively and negatively charged\ncoordination entities.\n(ii) The ligands are named in an alphabetical order before the name of the\ncentral atom/ion. (This procedure is reversed from writing formula).\n(iii) Names of the anionic ligands end in –o, those of neutral and cationic\nligands are the same except aqua for H O, ammine for NH , carbonyl\n2 3\nfor CO and nitrosyl for NO. While writing the formula of coordination\nentity, these are enclosed in brackets ( ).\n(iv) Prefixes mono, di, tri, etc., are used to indicate the number of the\nindividual ligands in the coordination entity. When the names of\nthe ligands include a numerical prefix, then the terms, bis, tris,\ntetrakis are used, the ligand to which they refer being placed in\nparentheses. For example, [NiCl (PPh ) ] is named as\n2 3 2\ndichloridobis(triphenylphosphine)nickel(II).\n(v) Oxidation state of the metal in cation, anion or neutral coordination\nentity is indicated by Roman numeral in parenthesis.\n(vi) If the complex ion is a cation, the metal is named same as the\nelement. For example, Co in a complex cation is called cobalt and\nNote: The 2004\nPt is called platinum. If the complex ion is an anion, the name of\nIUPAC draft\nrecommends that the metal ends with the suffix – ate. For example, Co in a complex\n2\nanionic ligands will anion,  CoSCN\n\n is called cobaltate. For some metals, the Latin\nend with–ido so that 4\nnames are used in the complex anions, e.g., ferrate for Fe.\nchloro would become\nchlorido, etc.\n123 Coordination Compounds\nReprint 2025-26\n(vii) The neutral complex molecule is named similar to that of the\ncomplex cation.\nThe following examples illustrate the nomenclature for coordination\ncompounds.\n1. [Cr(NH ) (H O) ]Cl is named as:\n3 3 2 3 3\ntriamminetriaquachromium(III) chloride\nExplanation: The complex ion is inside the square bracket, which is\na cation. The amine ligands are named before the aqua ligands\naccording to alphabetical order. Since there are three chloride ions in\nthe compound, the charge on the complex ion must be +3 (since the\ncompound is electrically neutral). From the charge on the complex\nion and the charge on the ligands, we can calculate the oxidation\nnumber of the metal. In this example, all the ligands are neutral\nmolecules. Therefore, the oxidation number of chromium must be\nthe same as the charge of the complex ion, +3.\n2.

The two forms are called\ndextro (d) and laevo (l) depending\nupon the direction they rotate the\nplane of polarised light in a\npolarimeter (d rotates to the right, l to\nthe left).

A simple example is provided by complexes\ncontaining the thiocyanate ligand, NCS–, which may bind through the\nnitrogen to give M–NCS or through sulphur to give M–SCN. Jørgensen\ndiscovered such behaviour in the complex [Co(NH ) (NO )]Cl , which is\n3 5 2 2\nobtained as the red form, in which the nitrite ligandis bound through\noxygen (–ONO), and as the yellow form, in which the nitrite ligand is\nbound through nitrogen (–NO ).\n2\n5.4.4 Coordination This type of isomerism arises from the interchange of ligands between\nIsomerism cationic and anionic entities of different metal ions present in a complex.\nAn example is provided by [Co(NH ) ][Cr(CN) ], in which the NH ligands\n36 6 3\nare bound to Co3+ and the CN– ligands to Cr3+. In its coordination\nisomer [Cr(NH ) ][Co(CN) ], the NH ligands are bound to Cr3+ and the\n3 6 6 3\nCN– ligands to Co3+.\n5.4.5 Ionisation This form of isomerism arises when the counter ion in a complex salt\nIsomerism is itself a potential ligand and can displace a ligand which can then\nbecome the counter ion.

But his theory could not answer basic questions like:\n(i) Why only certain elements possess the remarkable property of\nCCCCCooooommmmmpppppooooouuuuunnnnndddddsssss\nforming coordination compounds?\n(ii) Why the bonds in coordination compounds have directional\nproperties?\n(iii) Why coordination compounds have characteristic magnetic and\noptical properties?\nMany approaches have been put forth to explain the nature of\nbonding in coordination compounds viz. Valence Bond Theory (VBT),\nCrystal Field Theory (CFT), Ligand Field Theory (LFT) and Molecular\nOrbital Theory (MOT). We shall focus our attention on elementary\ntreatment of the application of VBT and CFT to coordination compounds.\n5.5.1 Valence According to this theory, the metal atom or ion under the influence of\nBond ligands can use its (n-1)d, ns, np or ns, np, nd orbitals for hybridisation\nTheory to yield a set of equivalent orbitals of definite geometry such as octahedral,\ntetrahedral, square planar and so on (Table 5.2). These hybridised orbitals\nare allowed to overlap with ligand orbitals that can donate electron pairs\nfor bonding. This is illustrated by the following examples.\nTable 5.2: Number of Orbitals and Types of Hybridisations\nCoordination Type of Distribution of hybrid\nnumber hybridisation orbitals in space\n4 sp3 Tetrahedral\n4 dsp2 Square planar\n5 sp3d Trigonal bipyramidal\n6 sp3d2 Octahedral\n6 d2sp3 Octahedral\nChemistry 128\nReprint 2025-26\nIt is usually possible to predict the geometry of a complex from\nthe knowledge of its\nmagnetic behaviour on\nthe basis of the valence\nbond theory.\nIn the diamagnetic\noctahedral complex,\n[Co(NH ) ]3+, the cobalt ion\n3 6\nis in +3 oxidation state\nand has the electronic\nconfiguration 3d6. The\nhybridisation scheme is as\nshown in diagram.\nSix pairs of electrons, one from each NH molecule, occupy the six\n3\nhybrid orbitals. Thus, the complex has octahedral geometry and is\ndiamagnetic because of the absence of unpaired electron. In the formation\nof this complex, since the inner d orbital (3d) is used in hybridisation,\nthe complex, [Co(NH ) ]3+ is called an inner orbital or low spin or spin\n3 6\npaired complex. The paramagnetic octahedral complex, [CoF ]3– uses\n6\nouter orbital (4d ) in hybridisation (sp3d2). It is thus called outer orbital\nor high spin or spin free complex. Thus:\nOrbitals of Co3+ion\n3d 4s 4p 4d\nsp3d2hybridised\norbitals of Co3+\n3d sp3d3 hybrid\n[CoF]3–\n6\n(outer orbital or\nhigh spin complex)\n3d Six pairs of electrons\nfrom six F–ions\nIn tetrahedral complexes\none s and three p orbitals\nare hybridised to form four\nequivalent orbitals oriented\ntetrahedrally. This is ill-\nustrated below for [NiCl ]2-.\n4\nHere nickel is in +2\noxidation state and the ion\nhas the electronic\nconfiguration 3d8. The\nhybridisation scheme is as\nshown in diagram.\nEach Cl– ion donates a pair of electrons. The compound is\nparamagnetic since it contains two unpaired electrons. Similarly,\n[Ni(CO) ] has tetrahedral geometry but is diamagnetic since nickel is in\n4\nzero oxidation state and contains no unpaired electron.\n129 Coordination Compounds\nReprint 2025-26\nIn the square planar complexes, the hybridisation involved is dsp2.\nAn example is [Ni(CN) ]2–. Here nickel is in +2 oxidation state and has\n4\nthe electronic configuration 3d8. The hybridisation scheme is as shown\nin diagram:\nOrbitals of Ni2+ion\n3d 4s 4p\ndsp2hybridised\norbitals of Ni2+\n3d dsp2 hydrid 4p\n[Ni(CN)]2–\n4\n(low spin complex)\n3d Four pairs of electrons 4p\nfrom 4 CN–groups\nEach of the hybridised orbitals receives a pair of electrons from a\ncyanide ion. The compound is diamagnetic as evident from the absence\nof unpaired electron.\nIt is important to note that the hybrid orbitals do not actually exist.\nIn fact, hybridisation is a mathematical manipulation of wave equation\nfor the atomic orbitals involved.\n5.5.2 Magnetic The magnetic moment of coordination compounds can be measured\nProperties by the magnetic susceptibility experiments. The results can be used to\nof obtain information about the number of unpaired electrons and hence\nCoordination structures adopted by metal complexes.\nCompounds A critical study of the magnetic data of coordination compounds of\nmetals of the first transition series reveals some complications. For\nmetal ions with upto three electrons in the d orbitals, like Ti3+ (d1); V3+\n(d2); Cr3+ (d3); two vacant d orbitals are available for octahedral\nhybridisation with 4s and 4p orbitals. The magnetic behaviour of these\nfree ions and their coordination entities is similar. When more than\nthree 3d electrons are present, the required pair of 3d orbitals for\noctahedral hybridisation is not directly available (as a consequence of\nHund’s rule). Thus, for d4 (Cr2+, Mn3+), d5 (Mn2+, Fe3+), d6 (Fe2+, Co3+)\ncases, a vacant pair of d orbitals results only by pairing of 3d electrons\nwhich leaves two, one and zero unpaired electrons, respectively.\nThe magnetic data agree with maximum spin pairing in many cases,\nespecially with coordination compounds containing d6 ions. However,\nwith species containing d4 and d5 ions there are complications. [Mn(CN) ]3–\n6\nhas magnetic moment of two unpaired electrons while [MnCl ]3– has a\n6\nparamagnetic moment of four unpaired electrons. [Fe(CN) ]3– has magnetic\n6\nmoment of a single unpaired electron while [FeF ]3– has a paramagnetic\n6\nmoment of five unpaired electrons. [CoF ]3– is paramagnetic with four\n6\nunpaired electrons while [Co(C O ) ]3– is diamagnetic. This apparent\n2 43\nanomaly is explained by valence bond theory in terms of formation of\ninner orbital and outer orbital coordination entities. [Mn(CN) ]3–, [Fe(CN) ]3–\n6 6\nand [Co(C O ) ]3– are inner orbital complexes involving d2sp3 hybridisation,\n2 43\nthe former two complexes are paramagnetic and the latter diamagnetic.\nOn the other hand, [MnCl ]3–, [FeF ]3– and [CoF ]3– are outer orbital\n6 6 6-\ncomplexes involving sp3d2 hybridisation and are paramagnetic\ncorresponding to four, five and four unpaired electrons.\nChemistry 130\nReprint 2025-26\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 55555.....77777 The spin only magnetic moment of [MnBr ]2– is 5.9 BM. Predict the\n4\ngeometry of the complex ion ?\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn Since the coordination number of Mn2+ ion in the complex ion is 4, it\nwill be either tetrahedral (sp3 hybridisation) or square planar (dsp2\nhybridisation). But the fact that the magnetic moment of the complex\nion is 5.9 BM, it should be tetrahedral in shape rather than square\nplanar because of the presence of five unpaired electrons in the d orbitals.\n5.5.3 Limitations While the VB theory, to a larger extent, explains the formation, structures\nof Valence and magnetic behaviour of coordination compounds, it suffers from\nBond the following shortcomings:\nTheory (i) It involves a number of assumptions.\n(ii) It does not give quantitative interpretation of magnetic data.\n(iii) It does not explain the colour exhibited by coordination compounds.\n(iv) It does not give a quantitative interpretation of the thermodynamic\nor kinetic stabilities of coordination compounds.\n(v) It does not make exact predictions regarding the tetrahedral and\nsquare planar structures of 4-coordinate complexes.\n(vi) It does not distinguish between weak and strong ligands.\n5.5.4 Crystal The crystal field theory (CFT) is an electrostatic model which considers\nField the metal-ligand bond to be ionic arising purely from electrostatic\nTheory interactions between the metal ion and the ligand. Ligands are treated\nas point charges in case of anions or point dipoles in case of neutral\nmolecules. The five d orbitals in an isolated gaseous metal atom/ion\nhave same energy, i.e., they are degenerate. This degeneracy is\nmaintained if a spherically symmetrical field of negative charges\nsurrounds the metal atom/ion. However, when this negative field is\ndue to ligands (either anions or the negative ends of dipolar molecules\nlike NH and H O) in a complex, it becomes asymmetrical and the\n3 2\ndegeneracy of the d orbitals is lifted. It results in splitting of the d\norbitals. The pattern of splitting depends upon the nature of the crystal\nfield. Let us explain this splitting in different crystal fields.\n(a) Crystal field splitting in octahedral coordination entities\nIn an octahedral coordination entity with six ligands surrounding\nthe metal atom/ion, there will be repulsion between the electrons in\nmetal d orbitals and the electrons (or negative charges) of the ligands.\nSuch a repulsion is more when the metal d orbital is directed towards\nthe ligand than when it is away from the ligand. Thus, the d\nx2y2\nandd orbitals which point towards the axes along the direction of\nz2\nthe ligand will experience more repulsion and will be raised in\nenergy; and the d , d and d orbitals which are directed between\nxy yz xz\nthe axes will be lowered in energy relative to the average energy in\nthe spherical crystal field. Thus, the degeneracy of the d orbitals\nhas been removed due to ligand electron-metal electron repulsions\nin the octahedral complex to yield three orbitals of lower energy, t\n2g\nset and two orbitals of higher energy, e set. This splitting of the\ng\n131 Coordination Compounds\nReprint 2025-26\ndegenerate levels due to the\npresence of ligands in a\ndefinite geometry is termed as\ncrystal field splitting and\nthe energy separation is\ndenoted by D (the subscript\no\no is for octahedral) (Fig.5.8).\nThus, the energy of the two e\ng\norbitals will increase by (3/5)\nD and that of the three t will\no 2g\ndecrease by (2/5)D .\no\nThe crystal field splitting,\nD , depends upon the field\no\nproduced by the ligand and\ncharge on the metal ion. Some\nligands are able to produce\nstrong fields in which case, the\nsplitting will be large whereas\nothers produce weak fields\nFig.5.8: d orbital splitting in an octahedral crystal field\nand consequently result in\nsmall splitting of d orbitals.\nIn general, ligands can be arranged in a series in the order of increasing\nfield strength as given below:\nI– < Br– < SCN– < Cl– < S2– < F– < OH– < C O 2– < H O < NCS–\n2 4 2\n< edta4– < NH < en < CN– < CO\n3\nSuch a series is termed as spectrochemical series. It is an\nexperimentally determined series based on the absorption of light\nby complexes with different ligands. Let us assign electrons in the d\norbitals of metal ion in octahedral coordination entities. Obviously,\nthe single d electron occupies one of the lower energy t orbitals. In\n2g\nd2 and d3 coordination entities, the d electrons occupy the t orbitals\n2g\nsingly in accordance with the Hund’s rule. For d4 ions, two possible\npatterns of electron distribution arise: (i) the fourth electron could\neither enter the t level and pair with an existing electron, or (ii) it\n2g\ncould avoid paying the price of the pairing energy by occupying the\ne level. Which of these possibilities occurs, depends on the relative\ng\nmagnitude of the crystal field splitting, D and the pairing energy, P\no\n(P represents the energy required for electron pairing in a single\norbital). The two options are:\n(i) If D < P, the fourth electron enters one of the e orbitals giving the\no g\nconfiguration t3 e1. Ligands for which D < P are known as weak\n2g g o\nfield ligands and form high spin complexes.\n(ii) If D > P, it becomes more energetically favourable for the fourth\no\nelectron to occupy a t orbital with configuration t 4e 0. Ligands\n2g 2g g\nwhich produce this effect are known as strong field ligands and\nform low spin complexes.\nCalculations show that d4 to d7 coordination entities are more\nstable for strong field as compared to weak field cases.\nChemistry 132\nReprint 2025-26\n(b) Crystal field splitting in tetrahedral coordination entities\nIn tetrahedral coordination entity formation,\nthe d orbital splitting (Fig. 5.9) is inverted\nand is smaller as compared to the octahedral\nfield splitting. For the same metal, the same\nligands and metal-ligand distances, it can\nbe shown that D = (4/9) D . Consequently,\nt 0\nthe orbital splitting energies are not\nsufficiently large for forcing pairing and,\ntherefore, low spin configurations are rarely\nobserved. The ‘g’ subscript is used for the\noctahedral and square planar complexes\nwhich have centre of symmetry. Since\nFig.5.9: d orbital splitting in a tetrahedral\ntetrahedral complexes lack symmetry, ‘g’\ncrystal field.\nsubscript is not used with energy levels.\n5.5.5 Colour in In the previous Unit, we learnt that one of the most distinctive\nCoordination properties of transition metal complexes is their wide range of colours.\nCompounds This means that some of the visible spectrum is being removed from\nwhite light as it passes through the sample, so the light that emerges\nis no longer white. The colour of the complex is complementary to\nthat which is absorbed. The complementary colour is the colour\ngenerated from the wavelength left over; if green light is absorbed by\nthe complex, it appears red. Table 5.3 gives the relationship of the\ndifferent wavelength absorbed and the colour observed.\nTable 5.3:Relationship between the Wavelength of Light absorbed and the\nColour observed in some Coordination Entities\nCoordinaton Wavelength of light Colour of light Colour of coordination\nentity absorbed (nm) absorbed entity\n[CoCl(NH ) ]2+ 535 Yellow Violet\n3 5\n[Co(NH ) (H O)]3+ 500 Blue Green Red\n35 2\n[Co(NH ) ]3+ 475 Blue Yellow Orange\n36\n[Co(CN) ]3– 310 Ultraviolet Not in visible Pale Yellow\n6 region\n[Cu(H O) ]2+ 600 Red Blue\n2 4\n[Ti(H O) ]3+ 498 Blue Green Violet\n2 6\nThe colour in the coordination compounds can be readily explained\nin terms of the crystal field theory. Consider, for example, the complex\n[Ti(H O) ]3+, which is violet in colour. This is an octahedral complex\n2 6\nwhere the single electron (Ti3+ is a 3d1 system) in the metal d orbital is\nin the t level in the ground state of the complex. The next higher state\n2g\navailable for the electron is the empty e level. If light corresponding to\ng\nthe energy of blue-green region is absorbed by the complex, it would\nexcite the electron from t level to the e level (t 1e 0 fi t 0e 1).\n2g g 2g g 2g g\nConsequently, the complex appears violet in colour (Fig. 5.10). The\ncrystal field theory attributes the colour of the coordination compounds\nto d-d transition of the electron.\n133 Coordination Compounds\nReprint 2025-26\nIt is important to note that\nin the absence of ligand,\ncrystal field splitting does\nnot occur and hence the\nsubstance is colourless.

Gold can be separated in metallic\n2\nform from this solution by the addition of zinc.\n• Similarly, purification of metals can be achieved through formation\nand subsequent decomposition of their coordination compounds.\nChemistry 136\nReprint 2025-26\nFor example, impure nickel is converted to [Ni(CO) ], which is\n4\ndecomposed to yield pure nickel.\n• Coordination compounds are of great importance in biological\nsystems. The pigment responsible for photosynthesis, chlorophyll,\nis a coordination compound of magnesium. Haemoglobin, the red\npigment of blood which acts as oxygen carrier is a coordination\ncompound of iron. Vitamin B , cyanocobalamine, the anti–\n12\npernicious anaemia factor, is a coordination compound of cobalt.\nAmong the other compounds of biological importance with\ncoordinated metal ions are the enzymes like, carboxypeptidase A\nand carbonic anhydrase (catalysts of biological systems).\n• Coordination compounds are used as catalysts for many industrial\nprocesses. Examples include rhodium complex, [(Ph P) RhCl], a\n3 3\nWilkinson catalyst, is used for the hydrogenation of alkenes.\n• Articles can be electroplated with silver and gold much more\nsmoothly and evenly from solutions of the complexes, [Ag(CN) ]–\n2\nand [Au(CN) ]– than from a solution of simple metal ions.\n2\n• In black and white photography, the developed film is fixed by\nwashing with hypo solution which dissolves the undecomposed\nAgBr to form a complex ion, [Ag(S O ) ]3–.\n2 3 2\n• There is growing interest in the use of chelate therapy in medicinal\nchemistry. An example is the treatment of problems caused by the\npresence of metals in toxic proportions in plant/animal systems.\nThus, excess of copper and iron are removed by the chelating ligands\nD–penicillamine and desferrioxime B via the formation of coordination\ncompounds. EDTA is used in the treatment of lead poisoning. Some\ncoordination compounds of platinum effectively inhibit the growth\nof tumours. Examples are: cis–platin and related compounds.\nSSSSSuuuuummmmmmmmmmaaaaarrrrryyyyy\nThe chemistry of coordination compounds is an important and challenging\narea of modern inorganic chemistry. During the last fifty years, advances in this\narea, have provided development of new concepts and models of bonding and\nmolecular structure, novel breakthroughs in chemical industry and vital\ninsights into the functioning of critical components of biological systems.\nThe first systematic attempt at explaining the formation, reactions, structure\nand bonding of a coordination compound was made by A. Werner. His theory\npostulated the use of two types of linkages (primary and secondary) by a\nmetal atom/ion in a coordination compound. In the modern language of chemistry\nthese linkages are recognised as the ionisable (ionic) and non-ionisable (covalent)\nbonds, respectively. Using the property of isomerism, Werner predicted the\ngeometrical shapes of a large number of coordination entities.\nThe Valence Bond Theory (VBT) explains with reasonable success, the\nformation, magnetic behaviour and geometrical shapes of coordination compounds.\nIt, however, fails to provide a quantitative interpretation of magnetic behaviour\nand has nothing to say about the optical properties of these compounds.\nThe Crystal Field Theory (CFT) to coordination compounds is based on\nthe effect of different crystal fields (provided by the ligands taken as point charges),\n137 Coordination Compounds\nReprint 2025-26\non the degeneracy of d orbital energies of the central metal atom/ion. The\nsplitting of the d orbitals provides different electronic arrangements in strong\nand weak crystal fields. The treatment provides for quantitative estimations of\norbital separation energies, magnetic moments and spectral and stability\nparameters. However, the assumption that ligands consititute point charges\ncreates many theoretical difficulties.\nThe metal–carbon bond in metal carbonyls possesses both s and p character.\nThe ligand to metal is s bond and metal to ligand is p bond. This unique synergic\nbonding provides stability to metal carbonyls.\nCoordination compounds are of great importance. These compounds provide\ncritical insights into the functioning and structures of vital components of\nbiological systems. Coordination compounds also find extensive applications in\nmetallurgical processes, analytical and medicinal chemistry.\nExercises\n5.1 Explain the bonding in coordination compounds in terms of Werner’s postulates.\n5.2 FeSO solution mixed with (NH ) SO solution in 1:1 molar ratio gives the\n4 4 2 4\ntest of Fe2+ ion but CuSO solution mixed with aqueous ammonia in 1:4\n4\nmolar ratio does not give the test of Cu2+ ion.

In the presence of CO ligand, the unpaired d electrons of Ni pair up but\nCl– being a weak ligand is unable to pair up the unpaired electrons.\n5.7 In presence of CN–, (a strong ligand) the 3d electrons pair up leaving only one\nunpaired electron. The hybridisation is d2sp3 forming inner orbital complex. In\nthe presence of H O, (a weak ligand), 3d electrons do not pair up. The\n2\nhybridisation is sp3d2 forming an outer orbital complex containing five unpaired\nelectrons, it is strongly paramagnetic.\n5.8 In the presence of NH , the 3d electrons pair up leaving two d orbitals empty\n3\nto be involved in d2sp3 hybridisation forming inner orbital complex in case of [Co(NH)]3+.\n36\nIn Ni(NH ) 2+, Ni is in +2 oxidation state and has d8 configuration, the\n3 6\nhybridisation involved is sp3d2 forming outer orbital complex.\n5.9 For square planar shape, the hybridisation is dsp2. Hence the unpaired electrons\nin 5d orbital pair up to make one d orbital empty for dsp2 hybridisation. Thus\nthere is no unpaired electron.\nChemistry 140\nReprint 2025-26"

For such calculations, logarithms are very useful. They help us in making difficult calculations\neasy. In Chemistry, logarithm values are required in solving problems of chemical kinetics, thermodynamics,\nelectrochemistry, etc. We shall first introduce this concept, and discuss the laws, which will have to be\nfollowed in working with logarithms, and then apply this technique to a number of problems to show\nhow it makes difficult calculations simple.\nWe know that\n23 = 8, 32 = 9, 53 = 125, 70 = 1\nIn general, for a positive real number a, and a rational number m, let am = b,\nwhere b is a real number. In other words\nthe mth power of base a is b.\nAnother way of stating the same fact is\nlogarithm of b to base a is m.\nIf for a positive real number a, a „ 1\nam = b,\nwe say that m is the logarithm of b to the base a.\nb\nWe write this as log  m,\na\n“log” being the abbreviation of the word “logarithm”.\nThus, we have\nlog 8 = 3, Since2 3 = 8\n2\nlog 9 = 2, Since3 2 = 9\n3\nlog 125 = 3, Since5 3 =125\n5\nlog 1= 0, Since7 0 =1\n7\nLaws of Logarithms\nIn the following discussion, we shall take logarithms to any base a, (a > 0 and a „ 1)\nFirst Law: log (mn) = log m + log n\na a a\nProof: Suppose that log m = x and log n = y\na a\nThen ax= m, ay = n\nHence mn = ax.ay = ax+y\nIt now follows from the definition of logarithms that\nlog (mn) = x + y = log m – log n\na a a\nm\nSecond Law: log  = log m – log n\na  n  a a\nProof: Let log m = x, log n = y\na a\n145 Appendix\nReprint 2025-26\nThen ax = m, ay = n\nx\nm a\nxy\nHence   a\ny\nn a\nTherefore\nm\nlog    x  y  log m  log n\na a a\n n \nThird Law : log (mn) = n log m\na a\nProof : As before, if log m = x, then ax = m\na\nn  xn nx\nThen m  a  a\ngiving log (mn) = nx = n log m\na a\nThus according to First Law: “the log of the product of two numbers is equal to the sum of their logs.\nSimilarly, the Second Law says: the log of the ratio of two numbers is the difference of their logs. Thus,\nthe use of these laws converts a problem of multiplication/division into a problem of addition/subtraction,\nwhich are far easier to perform than multiplication/division. That is why logarithms are so useful in\nall numerical computations.\nLogarithms to Base 10\nBecause number 10 is the base of writing numbers, it is very convenient to use logarithms to the base\n10. Some examples are:\nlog 10 = 1, since 101 = 10\n10\nlog 100 = 2, since 102 = 100\n10\nlog 10000 = 4, since 104 = 10000\n10\nlog 0.01 = –2, since 10–2 = 0.01\n10\nlog 0.001 = –3, since 10–3 = 0.001\n10\nand log 1 = 0 since 100 = 1\n10\nThe above results indicate that if n is an integral power of 10, i.e., 1 followed by several zeros or\n1 preceded by several zeros immediately to the right of the decimal point, then log n can be easily found.\nIf n is not an integral power of 10, then it is not easy to calculate log n. But mathematicians have\nmade tables from which we can read off approximate value of the logarithm of any positive number\nbetween 1 and 10. And these are sufficient for us to calculate the logarithm of any number expressed\nin decimal form. For this purpose, we always express the given decimal as the product of an integral\npower of 10 and a number between 1 and 10.\nStandard Form of Decimal\nWe can express any number in decimal form, as the product of (i) an integral power of 10, and (ii)\na number between 1 and 10. Here are some examples:\n(i) 25.2 lies between 10 and 100\n25.2\n1\n25.2 = 10  2.5210\n10\n(ii) 1038.4 lies between 1000 and 10000.\n1038.4\n3 3\n 1038.4   10  1.0384  10\n1000\n(iii) 0.005 lies between 0.001 and 0.01\n\\ 0.005 = (0.005 × 1000) × 10–3 = 5.0 × 10–3\n(iv) 0.00025 lies between 0.0001 and 0.001\n\\ 0.00025 = (0.00025 × 10000) × 10–4 = 2.5 × 10–4\nChemistry 146\nReprint 2025-26\nIn each case, we divide or multiply the decimal by a power of 10, to bring one non-zero digit to the left\nof the decimal point, and do the reverse operation by the same power of 10, indicated separately.\nThus, any positive decimal can be written in the form\nn = m × 10p\nwhere p is an integer (positive, zero or negative) and 1< m < 10. This is called the “standard form of n.”\nWorking Rule\n1. Move the decimal point to the left, or to the right, as may be necessary, to bring one non-zero digit\nto the left of decimal point.\n2. (i) If you move p places to the left, multiply by 10p.\n(ii) If you move p places to the right, multiply by 10–p.\n(iii) If you do not move the decimal point at all, multiply by 100.\n(iv) Write the new decimal obtained by the power of 10 (of step 2) to obtain the standard form of\nthe given decimal.\nCharacteristic and Mantissa\nConsider the standard form of n\nn = m ×10p, where 1 < m < 10\nTaking logarithms to the base 10 and using the laws of logarithms\nlog n = log m + log 10p\n= log m + p log 10\n= p + log m\nHere p is an integer and as 1 < m < 10, so 0 < log m < 1, i.e., m lies between 0 and 1. When log\nn has been expressed as p + log m, where p is an integer and 0 log m < 1, we say that p is the\n“characteristic” of log n and that log m is the “mantissa of log n. Note that characteristic is always an\ninteger – positive, negative or zero, and mantissa is never negative and is always less than 1. If we can\nfind the characteristics and the mantissa of log n, we have to just add them to get log n.\nThus to find log n, all we have to do is as follows:\n1. Put n in the standard form, say\nn = m × 10p, 1 < m <10\n2. Read off the characteristic p of log n from this expression (exponent of 10).\n3. Look up log m from tables, which is being explained below.\n4. Write log n = p + log m\nIf the characteristic p of a number n is say, 2 and the mantissa is .4133, then we have log n = 2\n+ .4133 which we can write as 2.4133. If, however, the characteristic p of a number m is say –2 and the\nmantissa is .4123, then we have log m = –2 + .4123. We cannot write this as –2.4123. (Why?) In order\nto avoid this confusion we write 2 for –2 and thus we write log m = 2.4123 .\nNow let us explain how to use the table of logarithms to find mantissas. A table is appended at the\nend of this Appendix.\nObserve that in the table, every row starts with a two digit number, 10, 11, 12,... 97, 98, 99. Every\ncolumn is headed by a one-digit number, 0, 1, 2, ...9. On the right, we have the section called “Mean\ndifferences” which has 9 columns headed by 1, 2...9.\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..\n61 7853 7860 7868 7875 7882 7889 7896 7803 7810 7817 1 1 2 3 4 4 5 6 6\n62 7924 7931 7935 7945 7954 7959 7966 7973 7980 7987 1 1 2 3 3 4 5 6 6\n63 7993 8000 8007 8014 8021 8028 8035 8041 8048 8055 1 1 2 3 3 4 5 6 6\n.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..\n147 Appendix\nReprint 2025-26\nNow suppose we wish to find log (6.234). Then look into the row starting with 62. In this row, look\nat the number in the column headed by 3. The number is 7945. This means that\nlog (6.230) = 0.7945*\nBut we want log (6.234). So our answer will be a little more than 0.7945. How much more? We look\nthis up in the section on Mean differences. Since our fourth digit is 4, look under the column headed\nby 4 in the Mean difference section (in the row 62). We see the number 3 there. So add 3 to 7945. We\nget 7948. So we finally have\nlog (6.234) = 0.7948.\nTake another example. To find log (8.127), we look in the row 81 under column 2, and we find 9096.\nWe continue in the same row and see that the mean difference under 7 is 4. Adding this to 9096, and\nwe get 9100. So, log (8.127) = 0.9100.\nFinding N when log N is given\nWe have so far discussed the procedure for finding log n when a positive number n given. We now turn\nto its converse i.e., to find n when log n is given and give a method for this purpose. If log n = t, we\nsometimes say n = antilog t. Therefore our task is given t, find its antilog. For this, we use the ready-\nmade antilog tables.\nSuppose log n = 2.5372.\nTo find n, first take just the mantissa of log n. In this case it is .5372. (Make sure it is positive.)\nNow take up antilog of this number in the antilog table which is to be used exactly like the log table.\nIn the antilog table, the entry under column 7 in the row .53 is 3443 and the mean difference for the\nlast digit 2 in that row is 2, so the table gives 3445. Hence,\nantilog (.5372) = 3.445\nNow since log n = 2.5372, the characteristic of log n is 2. So the standard form of n is given by\nn = 3.445 × 102\nor n = 344.5\nIllustration 1:\nIf log x = 1.0712, find x.\nSolution: We find that the number corresponding to 0712 is 1179. Since characteristic of log x is 1, we\nhave\nx = 1.179 × 101\n= 11.79\nIllustration 2:\nIf log x = 2.1352, find x.\n10\nSolution: From antilog tables, we find that the number corresponding to 1352 is 1366. Since the\ncharacteristic is 2 i.e., –2, so\nx = 1.366 × 10–2 = 0.01366\nUse of Logarithms in Numerical Calculations\nIllustration 1:\nFind 6.3 × 1.29\nSolution: Let x = 6.3 × 1.29\nThen log x = log (6.3 × 1.29) = log 6.3 + log 1.29\n10\nNow,\nlog 6.3 = 0.7993\nlog 1.29 = 0.1106\n\\ log x = 0.9099,\n10\n* It should, however, be noted that the values given in the table are not exact. They are only approximate values,\nalthough we use the sign of equality which may give the impression that they are exact values. The same\nconvention will be followed in respect of antilogarithm of a number.\nChemistry 148\nReprint 2025-26\nTaking antilog\nx = 8.127\nIllustration

The common names of alkyl halides are derived by\nnaming the alkyl group followed by the name of halide. In the IUPAC system\nof nomenclature, alkyl halides are named as halosubstituted hydrocarbons.\nFor mono halogen substituted derivatives of benzene, common and IUPAC\nnames are the same. For dihalogen derivatives, the prefixes o-, m-, p- are\nused in common system but in IUPAC system, as you have learnt in Class\nXI, the numerals 1,2; 1,3 and 1,4 are used.\nThe dihaloalkanes having the same type of halogen atoms are named\nas alkylidene or alkylene dihalides. The dihalo-compounds having both\nthe halogen atoms are further classified as geminal halides or gem-dihalides\nwhen both the halogen atoms are present on the same carbon atom of the\n161 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\nchain and vicinal halides or vic-dihalides when halogen atoms are present\non adjacent carbon atoms. In common name system, gem-dihalides are\nnamed as alkylidene halides and vic-dihalides are named as alkylene\ndihalides. In IUPAC system, they are named as dihaloalkanes.\nSome common examples of halocompounds are mentioned in Table 6.1.\nTable 6.1: Common and IUPAC Names of some Halides\nStructure Common name IUPAC name\nCH CH CH(Cl)CH sec-Butyl chloride 2-Chlorobutane\n3 2 3\n(CH ) CCH Br neo-Pentyl bromide 1-Bromo-2,2-dimethylpropane\n3 3 2\n(CH ) CBr tert-Butyl bromide 2-Bromo-2-methylpropane\n3 3\nCH = CHCl Vinyl chloride Chloroethene\n2\nCH = CHCH Br Allyl bromide 3-Bromopropene\n2 2\no-Chlorotoluene 1-Chloro-2-methylbenzene\nor\n2-Chlorotoluene\nBenzyl chloride Chlorophenylmethane\nCH Cl Methylene chloride Dichloromethane\n2 2\nCHCl Chloroform Trichloromethane\n3\nCHBr Bromoform Tribromomethane\n3\nCCl Carbon tetrachloride Tetrachloromethane\n4\nCH CH CH F n-Propyl fluoride 1-Fluoropropane\n3 2 2\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 66666.....11111 Draw the structures of all the eight structural isomers that have the\nmolecular formula C H Br.

Fluorine atom is the smallest and iodine atom is the\nlargest. Consequently the carbon-halogen bond length also increases\nfrom C—F to C—I. Some typical bond lengths, bond enthalpies and\ndipole moments are given in Table 6.2.\nAlkyl halides are best prepared from alcohols, which are easily accessible.\n163 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\nTable 6.2: Carbon-Halogen (C—X) Bond Lengths, Bond\nEnthalpies and Dipole Moments\nBond Bond length/pm C-X Bond enthalpies/ kJmol-1 Dipole moment/Debye\nCH –F 139 452 1.847\n3\nCH – Cl 178 351 1.860\n3\nCH –Br 193 293 1.830\n3\nCH –I 214 234 1.636\n3\n66666.....44444 MMMMMeeeeettttthhhhhooooodddddsssss ooooofffff\nThe hydroxyl group of an alcohol is replaced by halogen on reaction with\nPPPPPrrrrreeeeepppppaaaaarrrrraaaaatttttiiiiiooooonnnnn concentrated halogen acids, phosphorus halides or thionyl chloride.\nThionyl chloride is preferred because in this reaction alkyl halide is formed\nooooofffff HHHHHaaaaallllloooooaaaaalllllkkkkkaaaaannnnneeeeesssss\nalong with gases SO and HCl. The two gaseous products are escapable,\n2\nhence, the reaction gives pure alkyl halides. The reactions of primary and\n6.4.1 From Alcohols\nsecondary alcohols with HCl require the presence of a catalyst, ZnCl .\n2\nWith tertiary alcohols, the reaction is conducted by simply shaking the\nalcohol with concentrated HCl at room temperature.

Higher members\nare liquids or solids. As we have already learnt, molecules of organic\nhalogen compounds are generally polar. Due to greater polarity as well\nas higher molecular mass as compared to the parent hydrocarbon, the\nintermolecular forces of attraction (dipole-dipole and van der Waals)\nare stronger in the halogen derivatives. That is why the boiling points\nof chlorides, bromides and iodides are considerably higher than those\nof the hydrocarbons of comparable molecular mass.\nThe attractions get stronger as the molecules get bigger in size and\nhave more electrons. The pattern of variation of boiling points of different\nhalides is depicted in Fig. 6.1. For the same alkyl group, the boiling\npoints of alkyl halides decrease in the order: RI> RBr> RCl> RF. This\nis because with the increase in size and mass of halogen atom, the\nmagnitude of van der Waal forces increases.\nFig. 6.1: Comparison of boiling points of some alkyl halides\nThe boiling points of isomeric haloalkanes decrease with increase\nin branching. For example, 2-bromo-2-methylpropane has the lowest\nboiling point among the three isomers.\nBoiling points of isomeric dihalobenzenes are very nearly the same.\nHowever, the para-isomers are high melting as compared to their ortho-\nand meta-isomers.

Less energy is released when new attractions are set up between\nthe haloalkane and the water molecules as these are not as strong as the\noriginal hydrogen bonds in water. As a result, the solubility of haloalkanes\nin water is low.

Haloalkanes are substrate in these reactions.\nIn this type of reaction, a nucleophile reacts with haloalkane (the\nsubstrate) having a partial positive charge on the carbon atom bonded\nto halogen. A substitution reaction takes place and halogen atom,\ncalled leaving group departs as halide ion. Since the substitution\nreaction is initiated by a nucleophile, it is called nucleophilic\nsubstitution reaction.\nIt is one of the most useful classes of organic reactions of alkyl\nhalides in which halogen is bonded to sp3 hybridised carbon.

Similarly nitrite ion also represents an ambident\nii\nnucleophile with two different points of linkage [–O—N=O]. The linkage\nthrough oxygen results in alkyl nitrites while through nitrogen atom, it\nleads to nitroalkanes.\nMechanism: This reaction has been found to proceed by two different\nmechanims which are described below:\n(a) Substitution nucleophilic bimolecular (S 2)\nN\nThe reaction between CH Cl and hydroxide ion to yield methanol and\n3\nchloride ion follows a second order kinetics, i.e., the rate depends\nupon the concentration of both the reactants.\nThe solid wedge represents the bond coming out of the paper, dashed line going down the\npaper and a straight line representing bond in the plane of the paper.\nThe above reaction can be represented diagrammatically as shown in\nFig. 6.2.\nFig. 6.2: Red ball represents the incoming hydroxide ion and green ball represents\nthe outgoing halide ion\nIn the year 1937, It depicts a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (S 2) reaction;\nN\nEdward Davies Hughes the incoming nucleophile interacts with alkyl halide causing the\nand Sir Christopher\ncarbon-halide bond to break and a new bond is formed between\nIngold proposed a\ncarbon and attacking nucleophile. Here it is C-O bond formed between\nmechanism for an S 2\nreaction. N C and -OH. These two processes take place simultaneously in a\n171 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\nsingle step and no intermediate is formed. As the reaction progresses\nand the bond between the incoming nucleophile and the carbon\natom starts forming, the bond between carbon atom and leaving\ngroup weakens. As this happens, the three carbon-hydrogen bonds\nof the substrate start moving away from the attacking nucleophile. In\ntransition state all the three C-H bonds are in the same plane and the\nattacking and leaving nucleophiles are partially attached to the\ncarbon. As the attacking nucleophile approaches closer to the carbon,\nC-H bonds still keep on moving in the same direction till the attacking\nnucleophile attaches to carbon and leaving group leaves the carbon.\nAs a result configuration is inverted, the configuration (See box) of\ncarbon atom under attack inverts in much the same way as an\numbrella is turned inside out when caught in a strong wind. This\nprocess is called as inversion of configuration. In the transition\nstate, the carbon atom is simultaneously bonded to incoming\nnucleophile and the outgoing leaving group. Such structures are\nunstable and cannot be isolated. Thus, in the transition state, carbon\nis simultaneously bonded to five atoms.\nConfiguration\nSpacial arrangement of functional groups around carbon is called its configuration.\nSee the structures (A) and (B) given below carefully.\nThese are the two structures of the same compound. They differ in spacial arrangement\nof functional groups attached to carbon. Structure (A) is mirror image of Structure (B).\nWe say configuration of carbon in structure (A) is mirror image of the configuration of\ncarbon in structure (B).\nHughes worked under Since this reaction requires the approach of the nucleophile to the\nIngold and earned a carbon bearing the leaving group, the presence of bulky substituents\nD.Sc. degree from the\non or near the carbon atom have a dramatic inhibiting effect. Of the\nUniversity of London.\nsimple alkyl halides, methyl halides react most rapidly in S 2 reactions\nN\nbecause there are only three small hydrogen atoms. Tertiary halides\nare the least reactive because bulky groups hinder the approaching\nChemistry 172\nReprint 2025-26\nnucleophiles.

The relative rate of S 2 reaction is given in parenthesis\nN N\n(b) Substitution nucleophilic unimolecular (S 1)\nN\nS 1 reactions are generally carried out in polar protic solvents\nN\n(like water, alcohol, acetic acid, etc.). The reaction between tert-\nbutyl bromide and hydroxide ion yields tert-butyl alcohol and\nfollows the first order kinetics, i.e., the rate of reaction depends\nupon the concentration of only one reactant, which is tert- butyl\nbromide.\nIt occurs in two steps. In step I, the polarised C—Br bond undergoes\nslow cleavage to produce a carbocation and a bromide ion. The\ncarbocation thus formed is then attacked by nucleophile in step II\nto complete the substitution reaction.\n173 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\nStep I is the slowest and reversible. It involves the C–Br bond breaking for which the\nenergy is obtained through solvation of halide ion with the proton of protic solvent. Since\nthe rate of reaction depends upon the slowest step, the rate of reaction depends only on the\nconcentration of alkyl halide and not on the concentration of hydroxide ion. Further, greater\nthe stability of carbocation, greater will be its ease of formation from alkyl halide and faster\nwill be the rate of reaction.

Such\ncompounds are called optically active compounds. The angle\nWilliam Nicol (1768- by which the plane polarised light is rotated is measured by an\n1851) developed the first instrument called polarimeter. If the compound rotates the plane\nprism that produced of plane polarised light to the right, i.e., clockwise direction, it\nplane polarised light.\nis called dextrorotatory (Greek for right rotating) or the d-form\nand is indicated by placing a positive (+) sign before the degree\nof rotation. If the light is rotated towards left (anticlockwise\ndirection), the compound is said to be laevo-rotatory or the\nl-form and a negative (–) sign is placed before the degree of\nrotation. Such (+) and (–) isomers of a compound are called\noptical isomers and the phenomenon is termed as optical\nisomerism.\n(ii) Molecular asymmetry, chirality and enantiomers: The\nobservation of Louis Pasteur (1848) that crystals of certain\ncompounds exist in the form of mirror images laid the\nfoundation of modern stereochemistry. He demonstrated that\naqueous solutions of both types of crystals showed optical\nrotation, equal in magnitude (for solution of equal concentration)\nbut opposite in direction. He believed that this difference in\noptical activity was associated with the three dimensional\narrangements of atoms in the molecules (configurations) of\n175 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\ntwo types of crystals. Dutch scientist, J. Van’t Hoff and French\nscientist, C. Le Bel in the same year (1874), independently\nargued that the spatial arrangement of four groups (valencies)\nJacobus Hendricus\naround a central carbon is tetrahedral and if all the substituents\nVan’t Hoff (1852-1911)\nattached to that carbon are different, the mirror image of the\nreceived the first Nobel\nmolecule is not superimposed (overlapped) on the molecule;\nPrize in Chemistry in\n1901 for his work on such a carbon is called asymmetric carbon or stereocentre.\nsolutions. The resulting molecule would lack symmetry and is referred to\nas asymmetric molecule. The asymmetry of the molecule along\nwith non superimposability of mirror images is responsible for\nthe optical activity in such organic compounds.\nThe symmetry and asymmetry are also observed in many day to day\nobjects: a sphere, a cube, a cone, are all identical to\ntheir mirror images and can be superimposed.\nHowever, many objects are non superimposable on\ntheir mirror images. For example, your left and right\nhand look similar but if you put your left hand on\nyour right hand by moving them in the same plane,\nthey do not coincide. The objects which are non-\nsuperimposable on their mirror image (like a pair\nof hands) are said to be chiral and this property is\nknown as chirality. Chiral molecules are optically\nactive, while the objects, which are, superimposable\non their mirror images are called achiral. These\nmolecules are optically inactive.\nThe above test of molecular chirality can be\napplied to organic molecules by constructing\nmodels and its mirror images or by drawing three\ndimensional structures and attempting to\nsuperimpose them in our minds. There are other\naids, however, that can assist us in recognising\nchiral molecules. One such aid is the presence of\nFig 6.4: Some common examples of chiral and\na single asymmetric carbon atom. Let us consider\nachiral objects\ntwo simple molecules propan-2-ol (Fig.6.5) and butan-2-ol (Fig.6.6)\nand their mirror images.\nFig 6.5: B is mirror image of A; B is rotated by 180o and C is\nobtained; C is superimposable on A.\nAs you can see very clearly, propan-2-ol (A) does not contain an asymmetric\ncarbon, as all the four groups attached to the tetrahedral carbon are not\ndifferent. We rotate the mirror image (B) of the molecule by 180° (structure\nC) and try to overlap the structure (C) with the structure (A), these structures\ncompletely overlap. Thus propan-2-ol is an achiral molecule.\nChemistry 176\nReprint 2025-26\nFig 6.6: E is mirror image of D; E is rotated by 180o to get F and F is\nnon superimposable on its mirror image D.\nButan-2-ol has four different groups attached to\nthe tetrahedral carbon and as expected is chiral.

A and B in Fig. 6.5 and D and E in Fig. 6.6 are\nenantiomers.\nEnantiomers possess identical physical properties namely,\nmelting point, boiling point, refractive index, etc. They only differ\nwith respect to the rotation of plane polarised light. If one of the\nenantiomer is dextro rotatory, the other will be laevo rotatory.\nHowever, the sign of optical rotation is not necessarily related to\nthe absolute (actual) configuration of the molecule.\nA mixture containing two enantiomers in equal proportions\nwill have zero optical rotation, as the rotation due to one isomer\nwill be cancelled by the rotation due to the other isomer. Such\na mixture is known as racemic mixture or racemic\nmodification. A racemic mixture is represented by prefixing dl\nor (–) before the name, for example (–) butan-2-ol. The process\nof conversion of enantiomer into a racemic mixture is known as\nracemisation.\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 66666.....88888 Identify chiral and achiral molecules in each of the following pair of\ncompounds.

Such a reaction is said\nto proceed with retention of the configuration. Consider as an\nexample, the reaction that takes place when (–)-2-methylbutan-1-ol\nis heated with concentrated hydrochloric acid.\nIt is important to note that configuration at a symmetric centre in\nthe reactant and product is same but the sign of optical rotation\nhas changed in the product. This is so because two different\ncompounds with same configuration at asymmetric centre may have\ndifferent optical rotation. One may be dextrorotatory (plus sign of\noptical rotation) while other may be laevorotatory (negative sign of\noptical rotation).\n(iv) Inversion, retention and racemisation: There are three outcomes\nfor a reaction at an asymmetric carbon atom, when a bond directly\nlinked to an asymmetric carbon atom is broken. Consider the\nreplacement of a group X by Y in the following reaction;\nIf (A) is the only compound obtained, the process is called retention\nof configuration. Note that configuration has been rotated in A.\nIf (B) is the only compound obtained, the process is called inversion\nof configuration. Configuration has been inverted in B.\nChemistry 178\nReprint 2025-26\nIf a 50:50 mixture of A and B is obtained then the process is called\nracemisation and the product is optically inactive, as one isomer will\nrotate the plane polarised light in the direction opposite to another.\nNow let us have a fresh look at S 1 and S 2 mechanisms by\nN N\ntaking examples of optically active alkyl halides.\nIn case of optically active alkyl halides, the product formed as a\nresult of S 2 mechanism has the inverted configuration as compared\nN\nto the reactant. This is because the nucleophile attaches itself on the\nside opposite to the one where the halogen atom is present. When\n(–)-2-bromooctane is allowed to react with sodium hydroxide,\n(+)-octan-2-ol is formed with the –OH group occupying the position\nopposite to what bromide had occupied.\nThus, S 2 reactions of optically active halides are accompanied by\nN\ninversion of configuration.\nIn case of optically active alkyl halides, S 1 reactions are\nN\naccompanied by racemisation. Can you think of the reason why it\nhappens? Actually the carbocation formed in the slow step being sp2\nhybridised is planar (achiral). The attack of the nucleophile may be\naccomplished from either side of the plane of carbocation resulting in\na mixture of products, one having the same configuration (the –OH\nattaching on the same position as halide ion) and the other having\nLocation of aaaaa and opposite configuration (the –OH attaching on the side opposite to halide\nbbbbb carbon in a ion). This may be illustrated by hydrolysis of optically active\nmolecule 2-bromobutane, which results in the formation of (–)-butan-2-ol.\nCarbon on which 2.

Since b-hydrogen\natom is involved in elimination, it is often called bbbbb-elimination.\nIf there is possibility of formation of more than one alkene due to\nthe availability of more than one b-hydrogen atoms, usually one alkene\nis formed as the major product.

A collection of molecules tend to do, by and large, what is easiest for them. An\nalkyl halide with b-hydrogen atoms when reacted with a base or a nucleophile has two\ncompeting routes: substitution (S 1 and S 2) and elimination. Which route will be taken\nN N\nup depends upon the nature of alkyl halide, strength and size of base/nucleophile and\nreaction conditions. Thus, a bulkier nucleophile will prefer to act as a base and abstracts\na proton rather than approach a tetravalent carbon atom (steric reasons) and vice versa.\nSimilarly, a primary alkyl halide will prefer a S 2 reaction, a secondary halide- S 2 or\nN N\nelimination depending upon the strength of base/nucleophile and a tertiary halide- S 1 or\nN\nelimination depending upon the stability of carbocation or the more substituted alkene.\n3.Reaction with metals\nMost organic chlorides, bromides and iodides react with certain\nmetals to give compounds containing carbon-metal bonds. Such\ncompounds are known as organo-metallic compounds. An\nimportant class of organo-metallic compounds discovered by Victor\nGrignard in 1900 is alkyl magnesium halide, RMgX, referred as\nGrignard Reagents. These reagents are obtained by the reaction of\nhaloalkanes with magnesium metal in dry ether.\nChemistry 180\nReprint 2025-26\nVictor Grignard had a strange start in academic life for a chemist - he\ntook a maths degree. When he eventually switched to chemistry, it was\nnot to the mathematical province of physical chemistry but to organic\nchemistry. While attempting to find an efficient catalyst for the process\nof methylation, he noted that Zn in diethyl ether had been used for this\npurpose and wondered whether the Mg/ether combination might be\nsuccessful. Grignard reagents were first reported in 1900 and Grignard\nused this work for his doctoral thesis in 1901. In 1910, Grignard obtained\na professorship at the University of Nancy and in 1912, he was awarded\nthe Nobel prize for Chemistry which he shared with Paul Sabatier who\nhad made advances in nickel catalysed hydrogenation.\nIn the Grignard reagent, the carbon-magnesium bond is covalent\nbut highly polar, with carbon pulling electrons from electropositive\nmagnesium; the magnesium halogen bond is essentially ionic.\nGrignard reagents are highly reactive and react with any source of\nproton to give hydrocarbons. Even water, alcohols, amines are sufficiently\nacidic to convert them to corresponding hydrocarbons.\nIt is therefore necessary to avoid even traces of moisture from a Grignard\nreagent. That is why reaction is carried out in dry ether. On the other\nhand, this could be considered as one of the methods for converting\nhalides to hydrocarbons.\nWurtz reaction\nAlkyl halides react with sodium in dry ether to give hydrocarbons\ncontaining double the number of carbon atoms present in the halide.\nThis reaction is known as Wurtz reaction.\n6.7.2 Reactionsof\n1. Nucleophilic substitution\nHaloarenes\nAryl halides are extremely less reactive towards nucleophilic\nsubstitution reactions due to the following reasons:\n(i) Resonance effect : In haloarenes, the electron pairs on halogen\natom are in conjugation with p-electrons of the ring and the\nfollowing resonating structures are possible.\nC—Cl bond acquires a partial double bond character due to\nresonance. As a result, the bond cleavage in haloarene is difficult\nthan haloalkane and therefore, they are less reactive towards\nnucleophilic substitution reaction.\n181 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\n(ii) Difference in hybridisation of carbon atom in C—X bond: In\nhaloalkane, the carbon atom attached to halogen is sp3\nhybridised while in case of haloarene, the carbon atom attached\nto halogen is sp2-hybridised.\nThe sp2 hybridised carbon with a greater s-character is more\nelectronegative and can hold the electron pair of C—X bond\nmore tightly than sp3-hybridised carbon in haloalkane with\nless s-chararcter. Thus, C—Cl bond length in haloalkane is\n177pm while in haloarene is 169 pm. Since it is difficult to\nbreak a shorter bond than a longer bond, therefore, haloarenes\nare less reactive than haloalkanes towards nucleophilic\nsubstitution reaction.\n(iii) Instability of phenyl cation: In case of haloarenes, the phenyl\ncation formed as a result of self-ionisation will not be stabilised\nby resonance and therefore, S 1 mechanism is ruled out.\nN\n(iv) Because of the possible repulsion, it is less likely for the electron\nrich nucleophile to approach electron rich arenes.\nReplacement by hydroxyl group\nChlorobenzene can be converted into phenol by heating in aqueous\nsodium hydroxide solution at a temperature of 623K and a pressure\nof 300 atmospheres.\nThe presence of an electron withdrawing group (-NO ) at ortho- and\n2\npara-positions increases the reactivity of haloarenes.\nChemistry 182\nReprint 2025-26\nThe effect is pronounced when (-NO ) group is introduced at ortho-\n2\nand para- positions. However, no effect on reactivity of haloarenes is\nobserved by the presence of electron withdrawing group at meta-position.\nMechanism of the reaction is as depicted:\nCan you think why does NO group show its effect only at ortho- and para- positions\n2\nand not at meta- position?\nAs shown, the presence of nitro group at ortho- and para-positions withdraws the\nelectron density from the benzene ring and thus facilitates the attack of the nucleophile\non haloarene. The carbanion thus formed is stabilised through resonance. The negative\ncharge appeared at ortho- and para- positions with respect to the halogen substituent is\nstabilised by –NO group while in case of meta-nitrobenzene, none of the resonating\n2\nstructures bear the negative charge on carbon atom bearing the –NO group. Therefore,\n2\nthe presence of nitro group at meta- position does not stabilise the negative charge and\nno effect on reactivity is observed by the presence of –NO group at meta-position.\n2\n183 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\n2. Electrophilic substitution reactions\nHaloarenes undergo the usual electrophilic reactions of the benzene\nring such as halogenation, nitration, sulphonation and Friedel-Crafts\nreactions. Halogen atom besides being slightly deactivating is o, p-\ndirecting; therefore, further substitution occurs at ortho- and para-\npositions with respect to the halogen atom. The o, p-directing influence\nof halogen atom can be easily understood if we consider the resonating\nstructures of halobenzene as shown:\nDue to resonance, the electron density increases more at ortho- and\npara-positions than at meta-positions. Further, the halogen atom\nbecause of its –I effect has some tendency to withdraw electrons from\nthe benzene ring. As a result, the ring gets somewhat deactivated as\ncompared to benzene and hence the electrophilic substitution reactions\nin haloarenes occur slowly and require more drastic conditions as\ncompared to those in benzene.\n(i) Halogenation\n(ii)Nitration\n(iii) Sulphonation\nChemistry 184\nReprint 2025-26\n(iv) Friedel-Crafts reaction\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 66666.....99999 Although chlorine is an electron withdrawing group, yet it is ortho-,\npara- directing in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. Why?\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn Chlorine withdraws electrons through inductive effect and releases\nelectrons through resonance. Through inductive effect, chlorine\ndestabilises the intermediate carbocation formed during the electrophilic\nsubstitution.\nThrough resonance, halogen tends to stabilise the carbocation and\nthe effect is more pronounced at ortho- and para- positions. The\ninductive effect is stronger than resonance and causes net electron\nwithdrawal and thus causes net deactivation. The resonance effect\ntends to oppose the inductive effect for the attack at ortho- and para-\npositions and hence makes the deactivation less for ortho- and para-\nattack. Reactivity is thus controlled by the stronger inductive effect\nand orientation is controlled by resonance effect.\n185 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\n3. Reaction with metals\nWurtz-Fittig reaction\nA mixture of an alkyl halide and aryl halide gives an alkylarene when\ntreated with sodium in dry ether and is called Wurtz-Fittig reaction.\nFittig reaction\nAryl halides also give analogous compounds when treated with sodium\nin dry ether, in which two aryl groups are joined together.

Many of these compounds are\nCCCCCooooommmmmpppppooooouuuuunnnnndddddsssss\nuseful in industry and agriculture. Some polyhalogen compounds are\ndescribed in this section.\n6.8.1 Dichloro- Dichloromethane is widely used as a solvent as a paint remover, as a\nmethane propellant in aerosols, and as a process solvent in the manufacture of\n(Methylene drugs. It is also used as a metal cleaning and finishing solvent. Methylene\nchloride) chloride harms the human central nervous system. Exposure to lower\nlevels of methylene chloride in air can lead to slightly impaired hearing\nand vision. Higher levels of methylene chloride in air cause dizziness,\nnausea, tingling and numbness in the fingers and toes. In humans, direct\nskin contact with methylene chloride causes intense burning and mild\nredness of the skin. Direct contact with the eyes can burn the cornea.\n6.8.2 Trichloro- Chemically, chloroform is employed as a solvent for fats, alkaloids,\nmethane iodine and other substances. The major use of chloroform today is in\n(Chloroform) the production of the freon refrigerant R-22. It was once used as a\ngeneral anaesthetic in surgery but has been replaced by less toxic,\nsafer anaesthetics, such as ether. As might be expected from its use as\nan anaesthetic, inhaling chloroform vapours depresses the central\nnervous system. Breathing about 900 parts of chloroform per million\nparts of air (900 parts per million) for a short time can cause dizziness,\nfatigue, and headache. Chronic chloroform exposure may cause damage\nto the liver (where chloroform is metabolised to phosgene) and to the\nkidneys, and some people develop sores when the skin is immersed in\nchloroform. Chloroform is slowly oxidised by air in the presence of\nlight to an extremely poisonous gas, carbonyl chloride, also known as\nphosgene. It is therefore stored in closed dark coloured bottles\ncompletely filled so that air is kept out.\n6.8.3 Triiodo- It was used earlier as an antiseptic but the antiseptic properties are\nmethane due to the liberation of free iodine and not due to iodoform itself. Due\n(Iodoform) to its objectionable smell, it has been replaced by other formulations\ncontaining iodine.\n6.8.4 Tetrachlo- It is produced in large quantities for use in the manufacture of\nromethane refrigerants and propellants for aerosol cans. It is also used as\n(Carbon feedstock in the synthesis of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals,\ntetrachloride) pharmaceutical manufacturing, and general solvent use. Until the mid\n1960s, it was also widely used as a cleaning fluid, both in industry,\nas a degreasing agent, and in the home, as a spot remover and as fire\nextinguisher. There is some evidence that exposure to carbon\ntetrachloride causes liver cancer in humans. The most common effects\nare dizziness, light headedness, nausea and vomiting, which can cause\npermanent damage to nerve cells. In severe cases, these effects can lead\nrapidly to stupor, coma, unconsciousness or death. Exposure to CCl\n4\ncan make the heart beat irregularly or stop. The chemical may irritate\nthe eyes on contact. When carbon tetrachloride is released into the air,\nit rises to the atmosphere and depletes the ozone layer. Depletion of the\n187 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\nozone layer is believed to increase human exposure to ultraviolet rays,\nleading to increased skin cancer, eye diseases and disorders, and\npossible disruption of the immune system.\n6.8.5 Freons The chlorofluorocarbon compounds of methane and ethane are collectively\nknown as freons. They are extremely stable, unreactive, non-toxic, non-\ncorrosive and easily liquefiable gases. Freon 12 (CCl F ) is one of the\n2 2\nmost common freons in industrial use. It is manufactured from\ntetrachloromethane by Swarts reaction. These are usually produced\nfor aerosol propellants, refrigeration and air conditioning purposes. By\n1974, total freon production in the world was about 2 billion pounds\nannually. Most freon, even that used in refrigeration, eventually makes\nits way into the atmosphere where it diffuses unchanged into the\nstratosphere. In stratosphere, freon is able to initiate radical chain\nreactions that can upset the natural ozone balance.\n6.8.6 p,p’-Dichlo- DDT, the first chlorinated organic insecticides, was originally prepared\nrodiphenyl- in 1873, but it was not until 1939 that Paul Muller of Geigy\ntrichloro- Pharmaceuticals in Switzerland discovered the effectiveness of DDT as\nethane(DDT) an insecticide. Paul Muller was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine\nand Physiology in 1948 for this discovery. The use of DDT increased\nenormously on a worldwide basis after World War II, primarily because\nof its effectiveness against the mosquito that spreads malaria and lice\nthat carry typhus. However, problems related to extensive use of DDT\nbegan to appear in the late 1940s. Many species of insects developed\nresistance to DDT, and it was also discovered to have a high toxicity\ntowards fish. The chemical stability of DDT and its fat solubility\ncompounded the problem. DDT is not metabolised very rapidly by\nanimals; instead, it is deposited and stored in the fatty tissues. If\ningestion continues at a steady rate, DDT builds up within the animal\nover time. The use of DDT was banned in the United States in 1973,\nalthough it is still in use in some other parts of the world.\nSSSSSuuuuummmmmmmmmmaaaaarrrrryyyyy\nAlkyl/ Aryl halides may be classified as mono, di, or polyhalogen (tri-, tetra-, etc.)\ncompounds depending on whether they contain one, two or more halogen atoms in\ntheir structures. Since halogen atoms are more electronegative than carbon, the carbon-\nhalogen bond of alkyl halide is polarised; the carbon atom bears a partial positive\ncharge, and the halogen atom bears a partial negative charge.\nAlkyl halides are prepared by the free radical halogenation of alkanes, addition\nof halogen acids to alkenes, replacement of –OH group of alcohols with halogens using\nChemistry 188\nReprint 2025-26\nphosphorus halides, thionyl chloride or halogen acids. Aryl halides are prepared by\nelectrophilic substitution to arenes. Fluorides and iodides are best prepared by halogen\nexchange method.\nThe boiling points of organohalogen compounds are comparatively higher than the\ncorresponding hydrocarbons because of strong dipole-dipole and van der Waals forces\nof attraction. These are slightly soluble in water but completely soluble in organic\nsolvents.\nThe polarity of carbon-halogen bond of alkyl halides is responsible for their\nnucleophilic substitution, elimination and their reaction with metal atoms to form\norganometallic compounds. Nucleophilic substitution reactions are categorised into\nS 1 and S 2 on the basis of their kinetic properties. Chirality has a profound role in\nN N\nunderstanding the reaction mechanisms of S 1 and S 2 reactions. S 2 reactions of\nN N N\nchiral alkyl halides are characterised by the inversion of configuration while S 1 reactions\nN\nare characterised by racemisation.\nA number of polyhalogen compounds e.g., dichloromethane, chloroform, iodoform,\ncarbon tetrachloride, freon and DDT have many industrial applications. However,\nsome of these compounds cannot be easily decomposed and even cause depletion of\nozone layer and are proving environmental hazards.\nExercises\n6.1 Name the following halides according to IUPAC system and classify them as\nalkyl, allyl, benzyl (primary, secondary, tertiary), vinyl or aryl halides:\n(i) (CH ) CHCH(Cl)CH (ii) CH CH CH(CH )CH(C H )Cl\n32 3 3 2 3 2 5\n(iii) CH CH C(CH ) CH I (iv) (CH ) CCH CH(Br)C H\n3 2 32 2 3 3 2 6 5\n(v) CH CH(CH )CH(Br)CH (vi) CH C(C H ) CH Br\n3 3 3 3 2 52 2\n(vii) CH C(Cl)(C H )CH CH (viii) CH CH=C(Cl)CH CH(CH )\n3 2 5 2 3 3 2 3 2\n(ix) CH CH=CHC(Br)(CH ) (x) p-ClC H CH CH(CH )\n3 3 2 6 4 2 32\n(xi) m-ClCH C H CH C(CH ) (xii) o-Br-C H CH(CH )CH CH\n2 6 4 2 33 6 4 3 2 3\n6.2 Give the IUPAC names of the following compounds:\n(i) CH CH(Cl)CH(Br)CH (ii) CHF CBrClF (iii) ClCH C”CCH Br\n3 3 2 2 2\n(iv) (CCl ) CCl (v) CH C(p-ClC H ) CH(Br)CH (vi) (CH ) CCH=CClC H I-p\n3 3 3 6 42 3 33 6 4\n6.3 Write the structures of the following organic halogen compounds.\n(i) 2-Chloro-3-methylpentane (ii) p-Bromochlorobenzene\n(iii) 1-Chloro-4-ethylcyclohexane (iv) 2-(2-Chlorophenyl)-1-iodooctane\n(v) 2-Bromobutane (vi) 4-tert-Butyl-3-iodoheptane\n(vii) 1-Bromo-4-sec-butyl-2-methylbenzene (viii) 1,4-Dibromobut-2-ene\n6.4 Which one of the following has the highest dipole moment?\n(i) CH Cl (ii) CHCl (iii) CCl\n2 2 3 4\n6.5 A hydrocarbon C H does not react with chlorine in dark but gives a single\n5 10\nmonochloro compound C H Cl in bright sunlight.

The nature of alkyl and aryl groups simply\nmodify these properties.\nBoiling Points\nThe boiling points of alcohols and phenols increase with increase in the\nnumber of carbon atoms (increase in van der Waals forces). In alcohols,\nthe boiling points decrease with increase of branching in carbon chain\n(because of decrease in van der Waals forces with decrease in surface\narea).\nThe –OH group in alcohols and phenols is involved in intermolecular\nhydrogen bonding as shown below:\nIt is interesting to note that boiling points of alcohols and phenols\nare higher in comparison to other classes of compounds, namely\nhydrocarbons, ethers, haloalkanes and haloarenes of comparable\nmolecular masses.

The boiling\npoint of methoxymethane is intermediate of the two boiling points.\n203 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers\nReprint 2025-26\nThe high boiling points of alcohols are mainly due to the presence\nof intermolecular hydrogen bonding in them which is lacking in ethers\nand hydrocarbons.\nSolubility\nSolubility of alcohols and phenols in\nwater is due to their ability to form\nhydrogen bonds with water molecules\nas shown.

Acidity of alcohols and phenols\n(i) Reaction with metals: Alcohols and phenols react with active\nmetals such as sodium, potassium and aluminium to yield\ncorresponding alkoxides/phenoxides and hydrogen.\nIn addition to this, phenols react with aqueous sodium\nhydroxide to form sodium phenoxides.\nOH ONa\n+ NaOH + H O\n2\nSodium phenoxide\nThe above reactions show that alcohols and phenols are\nacidic in nature. In fact, alcohols and phenols are Brönsted\nacids i.e., they can donate a proton to a stronger base (B:).\n(ii) Acidity of alcohols: The acidic character of alcohols is due to\nthe polar nature of O–H bond. An electron-releasing group\n(–CH , –C H ) increases electron density on oxygen tending to\n3 2 5\ndecrease the polarity of O-H bond. This decreases the acid\nstrength. For this reason, the acid strength of alcohols decreases\nin the following order:\n205 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers\nReprint 2025-26\nAlcohols are, however, weaker acids than water. This can be\nillustrated by the reaction of water with an alkoxide.\nThis reaction shows that water is a better proton donor (i.e.,\nstronger acid) than alcohol. Also, in the above reaction, we note\nthat an alkoxide ion is a better proton acceptor than hydroxide\nion, which suggests that alkoxides are stronger bases (sodium\nethoxide is a stronger base than sodium hydroxide).\nAlcohols act as Bronsted bases as well. It is due to the\npresence of unshared electron pairs on oxygen, which makes\nthem proton acceptors.\n(iii) Acidity of phenols: The reactions of phenol with metals (e.g.,\nsodium, aluminium) and sodium hydroxide indicate its acidic\nnature. The hydroxyl group, in phenol is directly attached to\nthe sp2 hybridised carbon of benzene ring which acts as an\nelectron withdrawing group. Due to this, the charge distribution\nin phenol molecule, as depicted in its resonance structures,\ncauses the oxygen of –OH group to be positive.\nThe reaction of phenol with aqueous sodium hydroxide\nindicates that phenols are stronger acids than alcohols and water.\nLet us examine how a compound in which hydroxyl group\nattached to an aromatic ring is more acidic than the one in\nwhich hydroxyl group is attached to an alkyl group.\nThe ionisation of an alcohol and a phenol takes place as follows:\nDue to the higher electronegativity of sp2 hybridised carbon\nof phenol to which –OH is attached, electron density decreases\non oxygen. This increases the polarity of O–H bond and results\nin an increase in ionisation of phenols than that of alcohols.\nNow let us examine the stabilities of alkoxide and phenoxide\nions. In alkoxide ion, the negative charge is localised on oxygen\nwhile in phenoxide ion, the charge is delocalised.\nThe delocalisation of negative charge (structures I-V) makes\nChemistry 206\nReprint 2025-26\nphenoxide ion more stable and favours the ionisation of phenol.\nAlthough there is also charge delocalisation in phenol, its\nresonance structures have charge separation due to which the\nphenol molecule is less stable than phenoxide ion.\nIn substituted phenols, the presence of electron withdrawing\ngroups such as nitro group, enhances the acidic strength of\nphenol. This effect is more pronounced when such a group is\npresent at ortho and para positions. It is due to the effective\ndelocalisation of negative charge in phenoxide ion when\nsubstituent is at ortho or para position. On the other hand,\nelectron releasing groups, such as alkyl groups, in general, do\nnot favour the formation of phenoxide ion resulting in decrease\nin acid strength. Cresols, for example, are less acidic than phenol.\nThe greater the pK a Table 7.3: pK Values of some Phenols and Ethanol\na\nvalue, the weaker the\nacid.\nCompound Formula pK\na\no-Nitrophenol o–O N–C H –OH 7.2\n2 6 4\nm-Nitrophenol m–O N–C H –OH 8.3\n2 6 4\np-Nitrophenol p-O N–C H –OH 7.1\n2 6 4\nPhenol C H –OH 10.0\n6 5\no-Cresol o-CH –C H –OH 10.2\n3 6 4\nm-Cresol m-CH C H –OH 10.1\n3 6 4\np-Cresol p-CH –C H –OH 10.2\n3 6 4\nEthanol C H OH 15.9\n2 5\nFrom the above data, you will note that phenol is million times\nmore acidic than ethanol.\nArrange the following compounds in increasing order of their acid strength: EEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 77777.....44444\nPropan-1-ol, 2,4,6-trinitrophenol, 3-nitrophenol, 3,5-dinitrophenol,\nphenol, 4-methylphenol.\nPropan-1-ol, 4-methylphenol, phenol, 3-nitrophenol, 3,5-dinitrophenol, SSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\n2,4, 6-trinitrophenol.\n2.

Today, most of the methanol is\nproduced by catalytic hydrogenation of carbon monoxide at high\npressure and temperature and in the presence of ZnO – Cr O\n2 3\ncatalyst.\nMethanol is a colourless liquid and boils at 337 K. It is highly\npoisonous in nature. Ingestion of even small quantities of methanol\ncan cause blindness and large quantities causes even death. Methanol\nis used as a solvent in paints, varnishes and chiefly for making\nformaldehyde.\n2. Ethanol\nEthanol, C H OH, is obtained commercially by fermentation, the\n2 5\noldest method is from sugars. The sugar in molasses, sugarcane\nor fruits such as grapes is converted to glucose and fructose, (both\nof which have the formula C H O ), in the presence of an enzyme,\n6 12 6\ninvertase. Glucose and fructose undergo fermentation in the\npresence of another enzyme, zymase, which is found in yeast.\nIn wine making, grapes are the source of sugars and yeast.

By dehydration of alcohols\nof Ethers\nAlcohols undergo dehydration in the presence of protic acids\n(H SO , H PO ). The formation of the reaction product, alkene or ether\n2 4 3 4\ndepends on the reaction conditions. For example, ethanol is\ndehydrated to ethene in the presence of sulphuric acid at 443 K.\nAt 413 K, ethoxyethane is the main product.\nDiethyl ether has been\nused widely as an\ninhalation anaesthetic.\nBut due to its slow\neffect and an\nunpleasant recovery The formation of ether is a nucleophilic bimolecular reaction (S 2)\nN\nperiod, it has been involving the attack of alcohol molecule on a protonated alcohol, as\nreplaced, as an indicated below:\nanaesthetic, by other\ncompounds.\nAcidic dehydration of alcohols, to give an alkene is also associated\nwith substitution reaction to give an ether.\nThe method is suitable for the preparation of ethers having\nprimary alkyl groups only. The alkyl group should be unhindered\nand the temperature be kept low. Otherwise the reaction favours the\nformation of alkene. The reaction follows S 1 pathway when the alcohol\nN\nis secondary or tertiary about which you will learn in higher classes.\nHowever, the dehydration of secondary and tertiary alcohols to give\ncorresponding ethers is unsuccessful as elimination competes over\nsubstitution and as a consequence, alkenes are easily formed.\nCan you explain why is bimolecular dehydration not appropriate\nfor the preparation of ethyl methyl ether?\n2.

For example, the reaction of\nCH ONa with (CH ) C–Br gives exclusively 2-methylpropene.\n3 3 3\nIt is because alkoxides are not only nucleophiles but strong bases\nas well.

In this, phenol\nis used as the phenoxide moiety.\nChemistry 216\nReprint 2025-26\n7.6.2 Physical The C-O bonds in ethers are polar and thus, ethers have a net dipole\nProperties moment. The weak polarity of ethers do not appreciably affect their\nboiling points which are comparable to those of the alkanes of\ncomparable molecular masses but are much lower than the boiling\npoints of alcohols as shown in the following cases:\nFormula CH (CH ) CH C H -O-C H CH (CH ) -OH\n3 23 3 2 5 2 5 3 23\nn-Pentane Ethoxyethane Butan-1-ol\nb.p./K 309.1 307.6 390\nThe large difference in boiling points of alcohols and ethers is due\nto the presence of hydrogen bonding in alcohols.\nThe miscibility of ethers with water resembles those of alcohols of\nthe same molecular mass. Both ethoxyethane and butan-1-ol are\nmiscible to almost the same extent i.e., 7.5 and 9 g per 100 mL water,\nrespectively while pentane is essentially immiscible with water. Can\nyou explain this observation ? This is due to the fact that just like\nalcohols, oxygen of ether can also form hydrogen bonds with water\nmolecule as shown:\n1. Cleavage of C–O bond in ethers\n7.6.3 Chemical\nReactions Ethers are the least reactive of the functional groups. The cleavage of\nC-O bond in ethers takes place under drastic conditions with excess\nof hydrogen halides. The reaction of dialkyl ether gives two alkyl\nhalide molecules.\nAlkyl aryl ethers are cleaved at the alkyl-oxygen bond due to the\nmore stable aryl-oxygen bond. The reaction yields phenol and alkyl\nhalide.\nEthers with two different alkyl groups are also cleaved in the same\nmanner.\nThe order of reactivity of hydrogen halides is as follows:\nHI > HBr > HCl. The cleavage of ethers takes place with concentrated\nHI or HBr at high temperature.\n217 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers\nReprint 2025-26\nMMMMMeeeeeccccchhhhhaaaaannnnniiiiisssssmmmmm\nThe reaction of an ether with concentrated HI starts with protonation of ether molecule.\nStep 1:\nThe reaction takes place with HBr or HI because these reagents are sufficiently acidic.\nStep 2:\nIodide is a good nucleophile. It attacks the least substituted carbon of the oxonium\nion formed in step 1 and displaces an alcohol molecule by S2 mechanism.\nN\nThus, in the cleavage of mixed ethers with two different alkyl groups, the alcohol\nand alkyl iodide formed, depend on the nature of alkyl groups. When primary or\nsecondary alkyl groups are present, it is the lower alkyl group that forms alkyl\niodide (S 2 reaction).\nN\nWhen HI is in excess and the reaction is carried out at high temperature,\nethanol reacts with another molecule of HI and is converted to ethyl iodide.\nStep 3:\nHowever, when one of the alkyl group is a tertiary group, the halide\nformed is a tertiary halide.\nCH 3 CH 3\nCH C O CH +HI CHOH+CH C I\n3 3 3 3\nCH CH\n3 3\nIt is because in step 2 of the reaction, the departure of leaving group\n(HO–CH ) creates a more stable carbocation [(CH ) C+], and the reaction\n3 33\nfollows S 1 mechanism.\nN\nIn case of anisole, methylphenyl\nCH CH\n3 3\n+ slow + oxonium ion, is\nCH C O CH CH C + CHOH\n3 3 3 3\nH\nCH 3 CH 3 formed by protonation of ether.

Dehydration of alcohols gives alkenes. On oxidation, primary alcohols\nyield aldehydes with mild oxidising agents and carboxylic acids with strong\noxidising agents while secondary alcohols yield ketones.

Aldehydes and ketones\nNomenclature\nAldehydes and ketones are the simplest and most important carbonyl\ncompounds.\nThere are two systems of nomenclature of aldehydes and ketones.\n(a) Common names\nAldehydes and ketones are often called by their common names\ninstead of IUPAC names. The common names of most aldehydes are\nderived from the common names of the corresponding carboxylic\nacids [Section 8.6.1] by replacing the ending –ic of acid with aldehyde.\nAt the same time, the names reflect the Latin or Greek term for the\noriginal source of the acid or aldehyde. The location of the substituent\nin the carbon chain is indicated by Greek letters a, b, g, d, etc. The\na-carbon being the one directly linked to the aldehyde group, b-\ncarbon the next, and so on. For example\nChemistry 228\nReprint 2025-26\nThe common names of ketones are derived by naming two alkyl\nor aryl groups bonded to the carbonyl group. The locations of\nsubstituents are indicated by Greek letters, a a¢, b b¢ and so on\nbeginning with the carbon atoms next to the carbonyl group,\nindicated as aa¢. Some ketones have historical common names,\nthe simplest dimethyl ketone is called acetone. Alkyl phenyl\nketones are usually named by adding the name of acyl group as\nprefix to the word phenone. For example\n(b) IUPAC names\nThe IUPAC names of open chain aliphatic aldehydes and ketones\nare derived from the names of the corresponding alkanes by\nreplacing the ending –e with –al and –one respectively. In case of\naldehydes the longest carbon chain is numbered starting from the\ncarbon of the aldehyde group while in case of ketones the\nnumbering begins from the end nearer to the carbonyl group. The\nsubstituents are prefixed in alphabetical order along with numerals\nindicating their positions in the carbon chain. The same applies to\ncyclic ketones, where the carbonyl carbon is numbered one. When\nthe aldehyde group is attached to a ring, the suffix carbaldehyde\nis added after the full name of the cycloalkane.

From hydrocarbons\nAromatic aldehydes (benzaldehyde and its derivatives) are prepared\nfrom aromatic hydrocarbons by the following methods:\n(i) By oxidation of methylbenzene\nStrong oxidising agents oxidise toluene and its derivatives to\nbenzoic acids. However, it is possible to stop the oxidation at\nthe aldehyde stage with suitable reagents that convert the methyl\ngroup to an intermediate that is difficult to oxidise further.

Ethanal is a volatile liquid.\nOther aldehydes and ketones are liquid or solid at room temperature.\nThe boiling points of aldehydes and ketones are higher than\nhydrocarbons and ethers of comparable molecular masses. It is due to\nweak molecular association in aldehydes and ketones arising out of the\ndipole-dipole interactions. Also, their boiling points are lower than those\nof alcohols of similar molecular masses due to absence of intermolecular\nhydrogen bonding.

Nucleophilic addition reactions\nContrary to electrophilic addition reactions observed in alkenes, the\naldehydes and ketones undergo nucleophilic addition reactions.\n(i) Mechanism of nucleophilic addition reactions\nA nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbon atom of the polar\ncarbonyl group from a direction approximately perpendicular\nto the plane of sp2 hybridised orbitals of carbonyl carbon (Fig.\n8.2). The hybridisation of carbon changes from sp2 to sp3 in\nthis process, and a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate is\nproduced. This intermediate captures a proton from the\nreaction medium to give\nthe electrically neutral\nproduct. The net result is\naddition of Nu– and H+\nacross the carbon oxygen\ndouble bond as shown in\nFig. 8.2.\nFig.8.2: Nucleophilic attack on carbonyl carbon\n(ii) Reactivity\nAldehydes are generally more reactive than ketones in\nnucleophilic addition reactions due to steric and electronic\nreasons. Sterically, the presence of two relatively large\nsubstituents in ketones hinders the approach of nucleophile to\ncarbonyl carbon than in aldehydes having only one such\nsubstituent. Electronically, aldehydes are more reactive than\nketones because two alkyl groups reduce the electrophilicity of\nthe carbonyl carbon more effectively than in former.\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 88888.....33333 Would you expect benzaldehyde to be more reactive or less reactive in\nnucleophilic addition reactions than propanal?

The polarity of the carbonyl\ngroup is reduced in benzaldehyde due\nto resonance as shown below and\nhence it is less reactive than propanal.\nChemistry 236\nReprint 2025-26\n(iii) Some important examples of nucleophilic addition and\nnucleophilic addition-elimination reactions:\n(a) Addition of hydrogen cyanide (HCN): Aldehydes\nand ketones react with hydrogen cyanide (HCN)\nto yield cyanohydrins. This reaction occurs very\nslowly with pure HCN. Therefore, it is catalysed\nby a base and the generated cyanide ion (CN-)\nbeing a stronger nucleophile readily adds to\ncarbonyl compounds to yield corresponding\ncyanohydrin.\nCyanohydrins are useful synthetic\nintermediates.\n(b) Addition of sodium hydrogensulphite: Sodium\nhydrogensulphite adds to aldehydes and\nketones to form the addition products.\nThe position of\nthe equilibrium\nlies largely to\nthe right hand\nside for most\naldehydes and to\nthe left for most\nketones due to steric reasons. The hydrogensulphite addition\ncompound is water soluble and can be converted back to the\noriginal carbonyl compound by treating it with dilute mineral\nacid or alkali. Therefore, these are useful for separation and\npurification of aldehydes.\n(c) Addition of Grignard reagents: (refer Unit 7, Class XII).\n(d) Addition of alcohols: Aldehydes react with one equivalent of\nmonohydric alcohol in the presence of dry hydrogen chloride\nto yield alkoxyalcohol intermediate, known as hemiacetals,\nwhich further react with one more molecule of alcohol to\ngive a gem-dialkoxy\ncompound known as\nacetal as shown in the\nreaction.\nKetones react with\nethylene glycol under\nsimilar conditions to form\ncyclic products known as\nethylene glycol ketals.\nDry hydrogen chloride\nprotonates the oxygen of\nthe carbonyl compounds\nand therefore, increases\nthe electrophilicity of the\ncarbonyl carbon facilitating\n237 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids\nReprint 2025-26\nthe nucleophilic attack of ethylene glycol.

Their oxidation\ninvolves carbon-carbon bond cleavage to afford a mixture of carboxylic\nacids having lesser number of carbon atoms than the parent ketone.\nThe mild oxidising agents given below are used to distinguish\naldehydes from ketones:\n(i) Tollens’ test: On warming an aldehyde with freshly prepared\nammoniacal silver nitrate solution (Tollens’ reagent), a bright\nsilver mirror is produced due to the formation of silver metal.\nThe aldehydes are oxidised to corresponding carboxylate anion.\nThe reaction occurs in alkaline medium.\n(ii) Fehling’s test: Fehling reagent comprises of two solutions,\nFehling solution A and Fehling solution B. Fehling solution A is\naqueous copper sulphate and Fehling solution B is alkaline\nsodium potassium tartarate (Rochelle salt). These two solutions\nare mixed in equal amounts before test. On heating an aldehyde\nwith Fehling’s reagent, a reddish brown precipitate is obtained.\nAldehydes are oxidised to corresponding carboxylate anion.\nAromatic aldehydes do not respond to this test.\n239 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids\nReprint 2025-26\n(iii) Oxidation of methyl ketones by haloform reaction:\nAldehydes and ketones having at least one methyl group\nlinked to the carbonyl carbon atom (methyl ketones)\nare oxidised by sodium hypohalite to sodium salts of\ncorresponding carboxylic\nacids having one carbon\natom less than that of\ncarbonyl compound.

Carboxylic acids are higher boiling\nliquids than aldehydes, ketones and even alcohols of\ncomparable molecular masses. This is due to more extensive\nassociation of carboxylic acid molecules through\nintermolecular hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonds are\nnot broken completely even in the vapour phase. In fact,\nIn vapour state or in most carboxylic acids exist as dimer in the vapour phase\naprotic solvent or in the aprotic solvents.\nSimple aliphatic carboxylic acids having upto four\ncarbon atoms are miscible in water due to the formation\nof hydrogen bonds with water. The solubility decreases\nwith increasing number of carbon atoms. Higher\ncarboxylic acids are practically insoluble in water due to\nthe increased hydrophobic interaction of hydrocarbon\npart.

However, unlike\nphenols they react with weaker bases such as carbonates and\nhydrogencarbonates to evolve carbon dioxide. This reaction is used to\ndetect the presence of carboxyl group in an organic compound.\nCarboxylic acids dissociate in water to give resonance stabilised\ncarboxylate anions and hydronium ion.\n249 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids\nReprint 2025-26\nFor the above reaction:\nwhere K , is equilibrium constant and K is the acid dissociation\neq a\nconstant.\nFor convenience, the strength of an acid is generally indicated by\nits pK value rather than its K value.\na a\npK = – log K\na a\nThe pK of hydrochloric acid is –7.0, where as pK of trifluoroacetic\na a\nacid (the strongest carboxylic acid), benzoic acid and acetic acid are\n0.23, 4.19 and 4.76, respectively.\nSmaller the pK , the stronger the acid ( the better it is as a proton\na\ndonor). Strong acids have pK values < 1, the acids with pK values\na a\nbetween 1 and 5 are considered to be moderately strong acids, weak\nacids have pK values between 5 and 15, and extremely weak acids\na\nhave pK values >15.\na\nCarboxylic acids are weaker than mineral acids, but they are stronger\nacids than alcohols and many simple phenols (pK is ~16 for ethanol\na\nand 10 for phenol). In fact, carboxylic acids are amongst the most acidic\norganic compounds you have studied so far. You already know why\nphenols are more acidic than alcohols. The higher acidity of carboxylic\nacids as compared to phenols can be understood similarly. The conjugate\nbase of carboxylic acid, a carboxylate ion, is stabilised by two equivalent\nresonance structures in which the negative charge is at the more\nelectronegative oxygen atom. The conjugate base of phenol, a phenoxide\nion, has non-equivalent resonance structures in which the negative charge\nis at the less electronegative carbon atom. Therefore, resonance in\nphenoxide ion is not as important as it is in carboxylate ion. Further, the\nnegative charge is delocalised over two electronegative oxygen atoms in\ncarboxylate ion whereas it is less effectively delocalised over one oxygen\natom and less electronegative carbon atoms in phenoxide ion (Unit 7,\nClass XII). Thus, the carboxylate ion is more stabilised than phenoxide\nion, so carboxylic acids are more acidic than phenols.\nEffect of substituents on the acidity of carboxylic acids:\nSubstituents may affect the stability of the conjugate base and thus,\nalso affect the acidity of the carboxylic acids. Electron withdrawing\ngroups increase the acidity of carboxylic acids by stabilising the\nconjugate base through delocalisation of the negative charge by\ninductive and/or resonance effects. Conversely, electron donating groups\ndecrease the acidity by destabilising the conjugate base.\nElectron withdrawing group (EWG) Electron donating group (EDG)\nstabilises the carboxylate anion destabilises the carboxylate\nand strengthens the acid anion and weakens the acid\nChemistry 250\nReprint 2025-26\nThe effect of the following groups in increasing acidity order is\nPh < I < Br < Cl < F < CN < NO < CF\n2 3\nThus, the following acids are arranged in order of increasing acidity\n(based on pK values):\na\nCF COOH > CCl COOH > CHCl COOH > NO CH COOH > NC-CH COOH >\n3 3 2 2 2 2\nFCH COOH > ClCH COOH > BrCH COOH > HCOOH > ClCH CH COOH >\n2 2 2 2 2\n(continue)\nC H COOH > C H CH COOH > CH COOH > CH CH COOH\n6 5 6 5 2 3 3 2\n(continue )\nDirect attachment of groups such as phenyl or vinyl to the carboxylic\nacid, increases the acidity of corresponding carboxylic acid, contrary to\nthe decrease expected due to resonance effect shown below:\nThis is because of greater electronegativity of sp2 hybridised carbon\nto which carboxyl carbon is attached. The presence of electron\nwithdrawing group on the phenyl of aromatic carboxylic acid increases\ntheir acidity while electron donating groups decrease their acidity.\nCOOH COOH COOH\nNO\nOCH 2\n3\n4-Methoxy Benzoic acid 4-Nitrobenzoic\nacid\nbenzoic acid\n(pK a = 4.46) (pK a = 4.19) (pK a = 3.41)\n8.9.2 Reactions 1.

Protonation of the\ncarbonyl oxygen activates the carbonyl group towards nucleophilic addition of the\nalcohol. Proton transfer in the tetrahedral intermediate converts the hydroxyl group\ninto –+OH group, which, being a better leaving group, is eliminated as neutral water\n2\nmolecule. The protonated ester so formed finally loses a proton to give the ester.\n3. Reactions with PCl , PCl and SOCl\n5 3 2\nThe hydroxyl group of carboxylic acids, behaves like that of alcohols\nand is easily replaced by chlorine atom on treating with PCl , PCl or\n5 3\nSOCl . Thionyl chloride (SOCl ) is preferred because the other two\n2 2\nproducts are gaseous and escape the reaction mixture making the\npurification of the products easier.\n4. Reaction with ammonia\nCarboxylic acids react with ammonia to give ammonium salt which\non further heating at high temperature give amides. For example:\nChemistry 252\nReprint 2025-26\n8.9.3 Reactions 1. Reduction\nInvolving\nCarboxylic acids are reduced to primary alcohols by lithium\n–COOH\naluminium hydride or better with diborane. Diborane does not easily\nGroup\nreduce functional groups such as ester, nitro, halo, etc. Sodium\nborohydride does not reduce the carboxyl group.\n2. Decarboxylation\nCarboxylic acids lose carbon dioxide to form hydrocarbons when their\nsodium salts are heated with sodalime (NaOH and CaO in the ratio of\n3 : 1). The reaction is known as decarboxylation.\nAlkali metal salts of carboxylic acids also undergo decarboxylation\non electrolysis of their aqueous solutions and form hydrocarbons having\ntwice the number of carbon atoms present in the alkyl group of the acid.\nThe reaction is known as Kolbe electrolysis (Unit 9, Class XI).\n8.9.4 Substitution 1. Halogenation\nReactions in the Carboxylic acids having an α-hydrogen are halogenated at the\nHydrocarbon Part α-position on treatment with chlorine or bromine in the presence of\nsmall amount of red phosphorus to give α-halocarboxylic acids.

Ring substitution\nAromatic carboxylic acids undergo electrophilic substitution reactions\nin which the carboxyl group acts as a deactivating and meta-directing\ngroup.

Sodium benzoate is used as a food preservative.\nHigher fatty acids are used for the manufacture of soaps and detergents.\nSSSSSuuuuummmmmmmmmmaaaaarrrrryyyyy\nAldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids are some of the important classes of\norganic compounds containing carbonyl group. These are highly polar molecules.\nTherefore, they boil at higher temperatures than the hydrocarbons and weakly\npolar compounds such as ethers of comparable molecular masses. The lower\nmembers are more soluble in water because they form hydrogen bonds with water.\nThe higher members, because of large size of hydrophobic chain of carbon atoms,\nare insoluble in water but soluble in common organic solvents. Aldehydes are\nprepared by dehydrogenation or controlled oxidation of primary alcohols and\ncontrolled or selective reduction of acyl halides. Aromatic aldehydes may also be\nprepared by oxidation of (i) methylbenzene with chromyl chloride or CrO in the\n3\npresence of acetic anhydride, (ii) formylation of arenes with carbon monoxide and\nhydrochloric acid in the presence of anhydrous aluminium chloride, and (iii) cuprous\nchloride or by hydrolysis of benzal chloride. Ketones are prepared by oxidation of\nsecondary alcohols and hydration of alkynes. Ketones are also prepared by reaction\nof acyl chloride with dialkylcadmium. A good method for the preparation of aromatic\nketones is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of aromatic hydrocarbons with acyl chlorides\nor anhydrides. Both aldehydes and ketones can be prepared by ozonolysis of alkenes.\nAldehydes and ketones undergo nucleophilic addition reactions onto the carbonyl\ngroup with a number of nucleophiles such as, HCN, NaHSO , alcohols (or diols),\n3\nChemistry 254\nReprint 2025-26\nammonia derivatives, and Grignard reagents. The a-hydrogens in aldehydes and\nketones are acidic. Therefore, aldehydes and ketones having at least one a-hydrogen,\nundergo Aldol condensation in the presence of a base to give a-hydroxyaldehydes\n(aldol) and a-hydroxyketones(ketol), respectively. Aldehydes having no a-hydrogen\nundergo Cannizzaro reaction in the presence of concentrated alkali. Aldehydes\nand ketones are reduced to alcohols with NaBH , LiAlH , or by catalytic hydrogenation.\n4 4\nThe carbonyl group of aldehydes and ketones can be reduced to a methylene group\nby Clemmensen reduction or Wolff-Kishner reduction. Aldehydes are easily\noxidised to carboxylic acids by mild oxidising reagents such as Tollens’ reagent and\nFehling’s reagent. These oxidation reactions are used to distinguish aldehydes from\nketones. Carboxylic acids are prepared by the oxidation of primary alcohols, aldehydes\nand alkenes by hydrolysis of nitriles, and by treatment of Grignard reagents with\ncarbon dioxide. Aromatic carboxylic acids are also prepared by side-chain oxidation\nof alkylbenzenes. Carboxylic acids are considerably more acidic than alcohols and\nmost of simple phenols. Carboxylic acids are reduced to primary alcohols with LiAlH ,\n4\nor better with diborane in ether solution and also undergo a-halogenation with Cl\n2\nand Br in the presence of red phosphorus (Hell-Volhard Zelinsky reaction).\n2\nMethanal, ethanal, propanone, benzaldehyde, formic acid, acetic acid and benzoic\nacid are highly useful compounds in industry.\nExercises\n8.1 What is meant by the following terms ?

Due to the presence of\nunshared pair of electrons, the angle C–N–E, (where E is\nReprint 2025-26\nC or H) is less than 109.5°; for instance, it is 108o in case of\ntrimethylamine as shown in Fig. 9.1.\nFig. 9.1 Pyramidal shape of trimethylamine\n99999.....22222 CCCCClllllaaaaassssssssssiiiiifffffiiiiicccccaaaaatttttiiiiiooooonnnnn Amines are classified as primary (1o), secondary (2o) and tertiary (3o)\ndepending upon the number of hydrogen atoms replaced by alkyl or\naryl groups in ammonia molecule. If one hydrogen atom of ammonia\nis replaced by R or Ar , we get RNH or ArNH , a primary amine (1o).\n2 2\nIf two hydrogen atoms of ammonia or one hydrogen atom of R-NH are\n2\nreplaced by another alkyl/aryl(R’) group, what would you get? You\nget R-NHR’, secondary amine. The second alkyl/aryl group may be\nsame or different. Replacement of another hydrogen atom by alkyl/aryl\ngroup leads to the formation of tertiary amine. Amines are said to be\n‘simple’ when all the alkyl or aryl groups are the same, and ‘mixed’\nwhen they are different.\n99999.....33333 NNNNNooooommmmmeeeeennnnnccccclllllaaaaatttttuuuuurrrrreeeee In common system, an aliphatic amine is named by prefixing alkyl\ngroup to amine, i.e., alkylamine as one word (e.g., methylamine). In\nsecondary and tertiary amines, when two or more groups are the same,\nthe prefix di or tri is appended before the name of alkyl group. In\nIUPAC system, primary amines are named as alkanamines. The name\nis derived by replacement of ‘e’ of alkane by the word amine. For\nexample, CH NH is named as methanamine. In case, more than one\n3 2\namino group is present at different positions in the parent chain, their\npositions are specified by giving numbers to the carbon atoms bearing\n–NH groups and suitable prefix such as di, tri, etc. is attached to the\n2\namine. The letter ‘e’ of the suffix of the hydrocarbon part is retained. For\nexample, H N–CH –CH –NH is named as ethane-1, 2-diamine.\n2 2 2 2\nTo name secondary and tertiary amines, we use locant N to designate\nsubstituent attached to a nitrogen atom. For example, CH NHCH CH is\n3 2 3\nChemistry 260\nReprint 2025-26\nnamed as N-methylethanamine and (CH CH ) N is named as N, N-\n3 2 3\ndiethylethanamine.

Reduction of nitro compounds\nNitro compounds are reduced to amines by passing hydrogen gas\nin the presence of finely divided nickel, palladium or platinum and\nalso by reduction with metals in acidic medium. Nitroalkanes can\nalso be similarly reduced to the corresponding alkanamines.\nReduction with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid is preferred because\nFeCl formed gets hydrolysed to release hydrochloric acid during the\n2\nreaction. Thus, only a small amount of hydrochloric acid is required\nto initiate the reaction.\n2. Ammonolysis of alkyl halides\nYou have read (Unit 6, Class XII) that the carbon - halogen bond in\nalkyl or benzyl halides can be easily cleaved by a nucleophile. Hence,\nan alkyl or benzyl halide on reaction with an ethanolic solution of\nammonia undergoes nucleophilic substitution reaction in which the\nhalogen atom is replaced by an amino (–NH ) group. This process of\n2\ncleavage of the C–X bond by ammonia molecule is known as\nammonolysis. The reaction is carried out in a sealed tube at 373\nK. The primary amine thus obtained behaves as a nucleophile and\ncan further react with alkyl halide to form secondary and tertiary\namines, and finally quaternary ammonium salt.\nChemistry 262\nReprint 2025-26\nThe free amine can be obtained from the ammonium salt by treatment\nwith a strong base:\nAmmonolysis has the disadvantage of yielding a mixture of primary,\nsecondary and tertiary amines and also a quaternary ammonium salt.\nHowever, primary amine is obtained as a major product by taking\nlarge excess of ammonia.\nThe order of reactivity of halides with amines is RI > RBr >RCl.\nWrite chemical equations for the following reactions: EEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 99999.....11111\n(i) Reaction of ethanolic NH with C H Cl.\n3 2 5\n(ii) Ammonolysis of benzyl chloride and reaction of amine so formed\nwith two moles of CH Cl.\n3\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn\n3.

Aniline and other arylamines are usually colourless but get\ncoloured on storage due to atmospheric oxidation.\nLower aliphatic amines are soluble in water because they can form\nhydrogen bonds with water molecules. However, solubility decreases\nwith increase in molar mass of amines due to increase in size of the\nhydrophobic alkyl part. Higher amines are essentially insoluble in water.\nConsidering the electronegativity of nitrogen of amine and oxygen of\nalcohol as 3.0 and 3.5 respectively, you can predict the pattern of\nsolubility of amines and alcohols in water. Out of butan-1-ol and\nbutan-1-amine, which will be more soluble in water and why? Amines\nare soluble in organic solvents like alcohol, ether and benzene. You\nmay remember that alcohols are more polar than amines and form\nstronger intermolecular hydrogen bonds than amines.\nPrimary and secondary amines are engaged in intermolecular\nassociation due to hydrogen bonding between nitrogen of one and\nhydrogen of another molecule. This intermolecular association is more\nin primary amines than in secondary amines as there are two hydrogen\natoms available for hydrogen bond formation in it. Tertiary amines do\nnot have intermolecular association due to the absence of hydrogen\natom available for hydrogen bond formation.

The number of hydrogen atoms attached to nitrogen\natom also decides the course of reaction of amines; that is why primary\n(–NH ), secondary N H and tertiary amines N differ in many\n2\nreactions. Moreover, amines behave as nucleophiles due to the presence\nof unshared electron pair. Some of the reactions of amines are described\nbelow:\n1. Basic character of amines\nAmines, being basic in nature, react with acids to form salts.\nChemistry 266\nReprint 2025-26\nAmine salts on treatment with a base like NaOH, regenerate the\nparent amine.\nAmine salts are soluble in water but insoluble in organic solvents\nlike ether. This reaction is the basis for the separation of amines from\nthe non basic organic compounds insoluble in water.\nThe reaction of amines with mineral acids to form ammonium salts\nshows that these are basic in nature. Amines have an unshared pair\nof electrons on nitrogen atom due to which they behave as Lewis base.\nBasic character of amines can be better understood in terms of their K\nb\nand pK values as explained below:\nb\n   \nRNH OH\n3\nK =\nR NH H O\n2 2\n   \nR NH OH\nor K[H O] = 3\n2 RNH \n2\n   \nR NH OH\nor K = 3\nb R NH \n2\npK = –log K\nb b\nLarger the value of K or smaller the value of pK , stronger is the\nb b\nbase. The pK values of few amines are given in Table 9.3.\nb\npK value of ammonia is 4.75. Aliphatic amines are stronger bases\nb\nthan ammonia due to +I effect of alkyl groups leading to high electron\ndensity on the nitrogen atom. Their pK values lie in the range of 3 to\nb\n4.22. On the other hand, aromatic amines are weaker bases than\nammonia due to the electron withdrawing nature of the aryl group.\nTable 9.3: pK Values of Amines in Aqueous Phase\nb\nName of amine pK\nb\nMethanamine 3.38\nN-Methylmethanamine 3.27\nN,N-Dimethylmethanamine 4.22\nEthanamine 3.29\nN-Ethylethanamine 3.00\nN,N-Diethylethanamine 3.25\nBenzenamine 9.38\nPhenylmethanamine 4.70\nN-Methylaniline 9.30\nN,N-Dimethylaniline 8.92\n267 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\nYou may find some discrepancies while trying to interpret the K\nb\nvalues of amines on the basis of +I or –I effect of the substituents\npresent in amines. Besides inductive effect, there are other effects like\nsolvation effect, steric hinderance, etc., which affect the basic strength\nof amines. Just ponder over. You may get the answer in the following\nparagraphs.\nStructure-basicity relationship of amines\nBasicity of amines is related to their structure. Basic character of\nan amine depends upon the ease of formation of the cation by\naccepting a proton from the acid. The more stable the cation is\nrelative to the amine, more basic is the amine.\n(a)Alkanamines versus ammonia\nLet us consider the reaction of an alkanamine and ammonia with\na proton to compare their basicity.\nDue to the electron releasing nature of alkyl group, it pushes\nelectrons towards nitrogen and thus makes the unshared electron\npair more available for sharing with the proton of the acid. Moreover,\nthe substituted ammonium ion formed from the amine gets stabilised\ndue to dispersal of the positive charge by the +I effect of the alkyl\ngroup. Hence, alkylamines are stronger bases than ammonia.\nThus, the basic nature of aliphatic amines should increase with\nincrease in the number of alkyl groups. This trend is followed in\nthe gaseous phase. The order of basicity of amines in the gaseous\nphase follows the expected order: tertiary amine > secondary amine\n> primary amine > NH . The trend is not regular in the aqueous\nstate as evident by th 3 eir pK values given in Table 9.3. In the\nb\naqueous phase, the substituted ammonium cations get stabilised\nnot only by electron releasing effect of the alkyl group (+I) but also\nby solvation with water molecules. The greater the size of the ion,\nlesser will be the solvation and the less stabilised is the ion. The\norder of stability of ions are as follows:\nDecreasing order of extent of H-bonding in water and order of\nstability of ions by solvation.\nChemistry 268\nReprint 2025-26\nGreater is the stability of the substituted ammonium cation, stronger\nshould be the corresponding amine as a base. Thus, the order of basicity\nof aliphatic amines should be: primary > secondary > tertiary, which\nis opposite to the inductive effect based order. Secondly, when the\nalkyl group is small, like –CH group, there is no steric hindrance to\n3\nH-bonding. In case the alkyl group is bigger than CH group, there will\n3\nbe steric hinderance to H-bonding. Therefore, the change of nature of\nthe alkyl group, e.g., from –CH to –C H results in change of the order\n3 2 5\nof basic strength. Thus, there is a subtle interplay of the inductive\neffect, solvation effect and steric hinderance of the alkyl group which\ndecides the basic strength of alkyl amines in the aqueous state. The\norder of basic strength in case of methyl substituted amines and ethyl\nsubstituted amines in aqueous solution is as follows:\n(C H ) NH > (C H ) N > C H NH > NH\n2 5 2 2 5 3 2 5 2 3\n(CH ) NH > CH NH > (CH ) N > NH\n3 2 3 2 3 3 3\n(b) Arylamines versus ammonia\npK value of aniline is quite high. Why is it so? It is because in\nb\naniline or other arylamines, the -NH group is attached directly to\n2\nthe benzene ring. It results in the unshared electron pair on nitrogen\natom to be in conjugation with the benzene ring and thus making\nit less available for protonation. If you write different resonating\nstructures of aniline, you will find that aniline is a resonance\nhybrid of the following five structures.\nOn the other hand, anilinium ion obtained by accepting a proton\ncan have only two resonating structures (kekule).\nWe know that greater the number of resonating structures, greater\nis the stability. Thus you can infer that aniline (five resonating\nstructures) is more stable than anilinium ion. Hence, the proton\nacceptability or the basic nature of aniline or other aromatic amines\nwould be less than that of ammonia. In case of substituted aniline, it\nis observed that electron releasing groups like –OCH , –CH increase\n3 3\nbasic strength whereas electron withdrawing groups like –NO , –SO H,\n2 3\n–COOH, –X decrease it.\n269 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 99999.....44444\nArrange the following in decreasing order of their basic strength:\nC H NH , C H NH , (C H ) NH, NH\n6 5 2 2 5 2 2 52 3\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn The decreasing order of basic strength of the above amines and ammonia\nfollows the following order:\n(C H ) NH > C H NH > NH > C H NH\n2 52 2 5 2 3 6 5 2\n2.Alkylation\nAmines undergo alkylation on reaction with alkyl halides (refer Unit\n6, Class XII).\n3.Acylation\nAliphatic and aromatic primary and secondary amines react with\nacid chlorides, anhydrides and esters by nucleophilic substitution\nreaction. This reaction is known as acylation. You can consider\nthis reaction as the replacement of hydrogen atom of –NH or >N–H\n2\ngroup by the acyl group. The products obtained by acylation reaction\nare known as amides. The reaction is carried out in the presence of\na base stronger than the amine, like pyridine, which removes HCl so\nformed and shifts the equilibrium to the right hand side.\nAmines also react with benzoyl chloride (C H COCl). This reaction\n6 5\nis known as benzoylation.\nCH NH  C H COCl  CH NHCOC H HCl\n3 2 6 5 3 6 5\nMethanamine Benzoyl chloride NMethylbenzamide\nWhat do you think is the product of the reaction of amines with\ncarboxylic acids ?

Carbylamine reaction\nAliphatic and aromatic primary amines on heating with chloroform\nand ethanolic potassium hydroxide form isocyanides or carbylamines\nwhich are foul smelling substances. Secondary and tertiary amines\ndo not show this reaction. This reaction is known as carbylamine\nreaction or isocyanide test and is used as a test for primary amines.\n5. Reaction with nitrous acid\nThree classes of amines react differently with nitrous acid which is\nprepared in situ from a mineral acid and sodium nitrite.\n(a) Primary aliphatic amines react with nitrous acid to form aliphatic\ndiazonium salts which being unstable, liberate nitrogen gas\nquantitatively and alcohols. Quantitative evolution of nitrogen is\nused in estimation of amino acids and proteins.\n(b) Aromatic amines react with nitrous acid at low temperatures\n(273-278 K) to form diazonium salts, a very important class of\ncompounds used for synthesis of a variety of aromatic compounds\ndiscussed in Section 9.7.\nSecondary and tertiary amines react with nitrous acid in a\ndifferent manner.\n6. Reaction with arylsulphonyl chloride\nBenzenesulphonyl chloride (C H SO Cl), which is also known as\n6 5 2\nHinsberg’s reagent, reacts with primary and secondary amines to\nform sulphonamides.\n(a)The reaction of benzenesulphonyl chloride with primary amine\nyields N-ethylbenzenesulphonyl amide.\nThe hydrogen attached to nitrogen in sulphonamide is strongly\nacidic due to the presence of strong electron withdrawing sulphonyl\ngroup. Hence, it is soluble in alkali.\n(b) In the reaction with secondary amine, N,N-diethyl-\nbenzenesulphonamide is formed.\nO O\nS Cl + H N C H S N C H + HCl\n2 5 2 5\nO C H O C H\n2 5 2 5\nN,N-Diethylbenzenesulphonamide\n271 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\nSince N, N-diethylbenzene sulphonamide does not contain any\nhydrogen atom attached to nitrogen atom, it is not acidic and hence\ninsoluble in alkali.\n(c) Tertiary amines do not react with benzenesulphonyl chloride.\nThis property of amines reacting with benzenesulphonyl chloride\nin a different manner is used for the distinction of primary,\nsecondary and tertiary amines and also for the separation of a\nmixture of amines. However, these days benzenesulphonyl\nchloride is replaced by p-toluenesulphonyl chloride.\n7. Electrophilic substitution\nYou have read earlier that aniline is a resonance hybrid of five\nstructures. Where do you find the maximum electron density in\nthese structures? Ortho- and para-positions to the –NH group\n2\nbecome centres of high electron density. Thus –NH group is ortho\n2\nand para directing and a powerful activating group.\n(a) Bromination: Aniline reacts with bromine water at room\ntemperature to give a white precipitate of 2,4,6-tribromoaniline.\nThe main problem encountered during electrophilic substitution\nreactions of aromatic amines is that of their very high reactivity.\nSubstitution tends to occur at ortho- and para-positions. If we\nhave to prepare monosubstituted aniline derivative, how can\nthe activating effect of –NH group be controlled ? This can be\n2\ndone by protecting the -NH group by acetylation with acetic\n2\nanhydride, then carrying out the desired substitution followed\nby hydrolysis of the substituted amide to the substituted amine.\nThe lone pair of electrons on nitrogen of acetanilide interacts\nwith oxygen atom due to resonance as shown below:\nChemistry 272\nReprint 2025-26\nHence, the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen is less available for\ndonation to benzene ring by resonance. Therefore, activating\neffect of –NHCOCH group is less than that of amino group.\n3\n(b) Nitration: Direct nitration of aniline yields tarry oxidation\nproducts in addition to the nitro derivatives. Moreover, in the\nstrongly acidic medium, aniline is protonated to form the\nanilinium ion which is meta directing. That is why besides the\northo and para derivatives, significant amount of meta derivative\nis also formed.\nHowever, by protecting the –NH group by acetylation reaction\n2\nwith acetic anhydride, the nitration reaction can be controlled\nand the p-nitro derivative can be obtained as the major product.\n(c) Sulphonation: Aniline reacts with concentrated sulphuric acid\nto form anilinium hydrogensulphate which on heating with\nsulphuric acid at 453-473K produces p-aminobenzene sulphonic\nacid, commonly known as sulphanilic acid, as the major product.\nAniline does not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction (alkylation and\nacetylation) due to salt formation with aluminium chloride, the\nLewis acid, which is used as a catalyst. Due to this, nitrogen of\naniline acquires positive charge and hence acts as a strong\ndeactivating group for further reaction.\n273 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n9.4 Arrange the following in increasing order of their basic strength:\n(i) C H NH , C H NH , NH , C H CH NH and (C H ) NH\n2 5 2 6 5 2 3 6 5 2 2 2 5 2\n(ii) C H NH , (C H ) NH, (C H ) N, C H NH\n2 5 2 2 5 2 2 5 3 6 5 2\n(iii) CH NH , (CH ) NH, (CH ) N, C H NH , C H CH NH .\n3 2 32 33 6 5 2 6 5 2 2\n9.5 Complete the following acid-base reactions and name the products:\n(i) CH CH CH NH + HCl fi (ii) (C H ) N + HCl fi\n3 2 2 2 2 5 3\n9.6 Write reactions of the final alkylation product of aniline with excess of methyl\niodide in the presence of sodium carbonate solution.\n9.7 Write chemical reaction of aniline with benzoyl chloride and write the name of\nthe product obtained.\n9.8 Write structures of different isomers corresponding to the molecular formula,\nC H N.

DIAZONIUM SALTS\n –\nThe diazonium salts have the general formula RN X where R stands\n2\nfor an aryl group and X – ion may be Cl– Br,– HSO, BF, etc. They are\n4 4\nnamed by suffixing diazonium to the name of the parent hydrocarbon\nfrom which they are formed, followed by the name of anion such as\n\nchloride, hydrogensulphate, etc. The N group is called diazonium\n2\n –\ngroup. For example, C H N Cl is named as benzenediazonium\n6 5 2\nchloride and C H N +HSO – is known as benzenediazonium\n6 5 2 4\nhydrogensulphate.\nPrimary aliphatic amines form highly unstable alkyldiazonium salts\n(refer to Section 9.6). Primary aromatic amines form arenediazonium\nsalts which are stable for a short time in solution at low temperatures\n(273-278 K).

Reactions involving displacement of nitrogen\nDiazonium group being a very good leaving group, is substituted\nby other groups such as Cl–, Br– I– CN– and OH– which displace\n, ,\nnitrogen from the aromatic ring. The nitrogen formed escapes from\nthe reaction mixture as a gas.\n1. Replacement by halide or cyanide ion: The Cl–, Br– and CN–\nnucleophiles can easily be introduced in the benzene ring in the\npresence of Cu(I) ion. This reaction is called Sandmeyer reaction.\n2 2\n2 2\nAlternatively, chlorine or bromine can also be introduced in the\nbenzene ring by treating the diazonium salt solution with corresponding\nhalogen acid in the presence of copper powder. This is referred as\nGatterman reaction.\nThe yield in Sandmeyer reaction is found to be better than\nGattermann reaction.\n2. Replacement by iodide ion: Iodine is not easily introduced into\nthe benzene ring directly, but, when the diazonium salt solution\nis treated with potassium iodide, iodobenzene is formed.\n3. Replacement by fluoride ion: When arenediazonium chloride is\ntreated with fluoroboric acid, arene diazonium fluoroborate is\nprecipitated which on heating decomposes to yield aryl fluoride.\n4. Replacement by H: Certain mild reducing agents like\nhypophosphorous acid (phosphinic acid) or ethanol reduce\ndiazonium salts to arenes and themselves get oxidised to\nphosphorous acid and ethanal, respectively.\n275 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\n5. Replacement by hydroxyl group: If the temperature of the\ndiazonium salt solution is allowed to rise upto 283 K, the salt\ngets hydrolysed to phenol.\n6. Replacement by –NO group: When diazonium fluoroborate is\n2\nheated with aqueous sodium nitrite solution in the presence of\ncopper, the diazonium group is replaced by –NO group.\n2\nB. Reactions involving retention of diazo group\ncoupling reactions\nThe azo products obtained have an extended conjugate system having\nboth the aromatic rings joined through the –N=N– bond. These compounds\nare often coloured and are used as dyes. Benzene diazonium chloride\nreacts with phenol in which the phenol molecule at its para position is\ncoupled with the diazonium salt to formp-hydroxyazobenzene. This\ntype of reaction is known as coupling reaction. Similarly the reaction of\ndiazonium salt with aniline yields p-aminoazobenzene. This is an example\nof electrophilic substitution reaction.\n99999.....1111100000 IIIIImmmmmpppppooooorrrrrtttttaaaaannnnnccccceeeee From the above reactions, it is clear that the diazonium salts are very\ngood intermediates for the introduction of –F, –Cl, –Br, –I, –CN, –OH,\nooooofffff DDDDDiiiiiaaaaazzzzzooooonnnnniiiiiuuuuummmmm\n–NO groups into the aromatic ring.\nSSSSSaaaaallllltttttsssss iiiiinnnnn 2\nAryl fluorides and iodides cannot be prepared by direct halogenation.\nSSSSSyyyyynnnnnttttthhhhheeeeesssssiiiiisssss The cyano group cannot be introduced by nucleophilic substitution of\nooooofffff AAAAArrrrrooooommmmmaaaaatttttiiiiiccccc chlorine in chlorobenzene but cyanobenzene can be easily obtained\nfrom diazonium salt.\nCCCCCooooommmmmpppppooooouuuuunnnnndddddsssss\nThus, the replacement of diazo group by other groups is helpful in\nChemistry 276\nReprint 2025-26\npreparing those substituted aromatic compounds which cannot be\nprepared by direct substitution in benzene or substituted benzene.\nHow will you convert 4-nitrotoluene to 2-bromobenzoic acid ?

Replacement of one hydrogen atom of\nammonia gives rise to structure of the type R-NH , known as primary amine.\n2\nSecondary amines are characterised by the structure R NH or R-NHR¢¢¢¢¢ and tertiary\n2\namines by R N, RNR¢¢¢¢¢R¢¢¢¢¢¢¢¢¢¢ or R NR¢¢¢¢¢..... Secondary and tertiary amines are known as\n3 2\nsimple amines if the alkyl or aryl groups are the same and mixed amines if the\ngroups are different. Like ammonia, all the three types of amines have one unshared\nelectron pair on nitrogen atom due to which they behave as Lewis bases.\nAmines are usually formed from nitro compounds, halides, amides, imides, etc.\nThey exhibit hydrogen bonding which influence their physical properties. In\nalkylamines, a combination of electron releasing, steric and H-bonding factors\ninfluence the stability of the substituted ammonium cations in protic polar solvents\nand thus affect the basic nature of amines. Alkyl amines are found to be stronger\nbases than ammonia. In aromatic amines, electron releasing and withdrawing groups,\nrespectively increase and decrease their basic character. Aniline is a weaker base\n277 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\nthan ammonia. Reactions of amines are governed by availability of the unshared pair\nof electrons on nitrogen. Influence of the number of hydrogen atoms at nitrogen atom\non the type of reactions and nature of products is responsible for identification and\ndistinction between primary, secondary and tertiary amines. p-Toluenesulphonyl chloride\nis used for the identification of primary, secondary and tertiary amines. Presence of\namino group in aromatic ring enhances reactivity of the aromatic amines. Reactivity of\naromatic amines can be controlled by acylation process, i.e., by treating with acetyl\nchloride or acetic anhydride. Tertiary amines like trimethylamine are used as insect\nattractants.\nAryldiazonium salts, usually obtained from arylamines, undergo replacement of\nthe diazonium group with a variety of nucleophiles to provide advantageous methods\nfor producing aryl halides, cyanides, phenols and arenes by reductive removal of the\ndiazo group. Coupling reaction of aryldiazonium salts with phenols or arylamines give\nrise to the formation of azo dyes.\nExercises\n9.1 Write IUPAC names of the following compounds and classify them into primary,\nsecondary and tertiary amines.\n(i) (CH ) CHNH (ii) CH (CH ) NH (iii) CH NHCH(CH )\n32 2 3 2 2 2 3 3 2\n(iv) (CH ) CNH (v) C H NHCH (vi) (CH CH ) NCH\n3 3 2 6 5 3 3 2 2 3\n(vii) m–BrC H NH\n6 4 2\n9.2 Give one chemical test to distinguish between the following pairs of compounds.\n(i) Methylamine and dimethylamine (ii) Secondary and tertiary amines\n(iii) Ethylamine and aniline (iv) Aniline and benzylamine\n(v) Aniline and N-methylaniline.\n9.3 Account for the following:\n(i) pK of aniline is more than that of methylamine.\nb\n(ii) Ethylamine is soluble in water whereas aniline is not.\n(iii) Methylamine in water reacts with ferric chloride to precipitate hydrated\nferric oxide.\n(iv) Although amino group is o– and p– directing in aromatic electrophilic\nsubstitution reactions, aniline on nitration gives a substantial amount of\nm-nitroaniline.\n(v) Aniline does not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction.\n(vi) Diazonium salts of aromatic amines are more stable than those of aliphatic\namines.\n(vii) Gabriel phthalimide synthesis is preferred for synthesising primary amines.\n9.4 Arrange the following:\n(i) In decreasing order of the pK values:\nb\nC H NH , C H NHCH , (C H ) NH and C H NH\n2 5 2 6 5 3 2 52 6 5 2\n(ii) In increasing order of basic strength:\nC H NH , C H N(CH ) , (C H ) NH and CH NH\n6 5 2 6 5 32 2 5 2 3 2\n(iii) In increasing order of basic strength:\n(a) Aniline, p-nitroaniline and p-toluidine\nChemistry 278\nReprint 2025-26\n(b) C H NH , C H NHCH , C H CH NH .\n6 5 2 6 5 3 6 5 2 2\n(iv) In decreasing order of basic strength in gas phase:\nC H NH , (C H ) NH, (C H ) N and NH\n2 5 2 2 52 2 53 3\n(v) In increasing order of boiling point:\nC H OH, (CH ) NH, C H NH\n2 5 32 2 5 2\n(vi) In increasing order of solubility in water:\nC H NH , (C H ) NH, C H NH .\n6 5 2 2 52 2 5 2\n9.5 How will you convert:\n(i) Ethanoic acid into methanamine\n(ii) Hexanenitrile into 1-aminopentane\n(iii) Methanol to ethanoic acid\n(iv) Ethanamine into methanamine\n(v) Ethanoic acid into propanoic acid\n(vi) Methanamine into ethanamine\n(vii) Nitromethane into dimethylamine\n(viii) Propanoic acid into ethanoic acid?\n9.6 Describe a method for the identification of primary, secondary and tertiary amines.\nAlso write chemical equations of the reactions involved.\n9.7 Write short notes on the following:\n(i) Carbylamine reaction (ii) Diazotisation\n(iii) Hofmann’s bromamide reaction (iv) Coupling reaction\n(v) Ammonolysis (vi) Acetylation\n(vii) Gabriel phthalimide synthesis.\n9.8 Accomplish the following conversions:\n(i) Nitrobenzene to benzoic acid\n(ii) Benzene to m-bromophenol\n(iii) Benzoic acid to aniline\n(iv) Aniline to 2,4,6-tribromofluorobenzene\n(v) Benzyl chloride to 2-phenylethanamine\n(vi) Chlorobenzene to p-chloroaniline\n(vii) Aniline to p-bromoaniline\n(viii) Benzamide to toluene\n(ix) Aniline to benzyl alcohol.\n9.9 Give the structures of A, B and C in the following reactions:\n(i) CH CH INaCNA OH BNaOHBr 2C\n3 2 Partial hydrolysis\n(ii) C H N ClCuCNA H 2 O/H  BNH3 C\n6 5 2 \n(iii) CH CH BrKCN A LiAlH 4BHNO 2C\n3 2 0C\n(iv) C H NO Fe/HCl A NaNO 2HClBH 2 O/H  C\n6 5 2 273K \n(v) CH COOHNH3 ANaOBrBNaNO 2/HClC\n3 \n(vi) C H NO Fe/HCl A HNO 2BC 6 H5 OHC\n6 5 2 273K\n279 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\n9.10 An aromatic compound ‘A’ on treatment with aqueous ammonia and heating\nforms compound ‘B’ which on heating with Br and KOH forms a compound ‘C’\n2\nof molecular formula C H N.

These biomolecules interact with each other\nand constitute the molecular logic of life processes. In\naddition, some simple molecules like vitamins and\nmineral salts also play an important role in the functions\nof organisms. Structures and functions of some of these\nbiomolecules are discussed in this Unit.\n1111100000.....11111CCCCCaaaaarrrrrbbbbbooooohhhhhyyyyydddddrrrrraaaaattttteeeeesssss Carbohydrates are primarily produced by plants and form a very large\ngroup of naturally occurring organic compounds. Some common\nexamples of carbohydrates are cane sugar, glucose, starch, etc. Most of\nthem have a general formula, C (H O) , and were considered as hydrates\nx 2 y\nof carbon from where the name carbohydrate was derived. For example,\nthe molecular formula of glucose (C H O ) fits into this general formula,\n6 12 6\nC (H O) . But all the compounds which fit into this formula may not be\n6 2 6\nclassified as carbohydrates. For example acetic acid (CH COOH) fits into\n3\nthis general formula, C (H O) but is not a carbohydrate. Similarly,\n2 2 2\nrhamnose, C H O is a carbohydrate but does not fit in this definition.\n6 12 5\nA large number of their reactions have shown that they contain specific\nfunctional groups. Chemically, the carbohydrates may be defined as\noptically active polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones or the compounds\nwhich produce such units on hydrolysis. Some of the carbohydrates,\nwhich are sweet in taste, are also called sugars. The most common\nsugar, used in our homes is named as sucrose whereas the sugar present\nReprint 2025-26\nin milk is known as lactose. Carbohydrates are also called saccharides\n(Greek: sakcharon means sugar).\nCarbohydrates are classified on the basis of their behaviour on\nhydrolysis. They have been broadly divided into following three groups.\n10.1.1 (i) Monosaccharides: A carbohydrate that cannot be hydrolysed further\nClassification of to give simpler unit of polyhydroxy aldehyde or ketone is called a\nCarbohydrates monosaccharide. About 20 monosaccharides are known to occur in\nnature. Some common examples are glucose, fructose, ribose, etc.\n(ii) Oligosaccharides: Carbohydrates that yield two to ten\nmonosaccharide units, on hydrolysis, are called oligosaccharides. They\nare further classified as disaccharides, trisaccharides, tetrasaccharides,\netc., depending upon the number of monosaccharides, they provide\non hydrolysis. Amongst these the most common are disaccharides.\nThe two monosaccharide units obtained on hydrolysis of a disaccharide\nmay be same or different. For example, one molecule of sucrose on\nhydrolysis gives one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose\nwhereas maltose gives two molecules of only glucose.\n(iii) Polysaccharides: Carbohydrates which yield a large number of\nmonosaccharide units on hydrolysis are called polysaccharides.\nSome common examples are starch, cellulose, glycogen, gums,\netc. Polysaccharides are not sweet in taste, hence they are also\ncalled non-sugars.\nThe carbohydrates may also be classified as either reducing or non-\nreducing sugars. All those carbohydrates which reduce Fehling’s\nsolution and Tollens’ reagent are referred to as reducing sugars. All\nmonosaccharides whether aldose or ketose are reducing sugars.\n10.1.2 Monosaccharides are further classified on the basis of number of carbon\nMonosaccharides atoms and the functional group present in them. If a monosaccharide\ncontains an aldehyde group, it is known as an aldose and if it contains\na keto group, it is known as a ketose. Number of carbon atoms\nconstituting the monosaccharide is also introduced in the name as is\nevident from the examples given in Table 10.1\nTable 10.1: Different Types of Monosaccharides\nCarbon atoms General term Aldehyde Ketone\n3 Triose Aldotriose Ketotriose\n4 Tetrose Aldotetrose Ketotetrose\n5 Pentose Aldopentose Ketopentose\n6 Hexose Aldohexose Ketohexose\n7 Heptose Aldoheptose Ketoheptose\n10.1.2.1 Glucose Glucose occurs freely in nature as well as in the combined form. It is\npresent in sweet fruits and honey. Ripe grapes also contain glucose\nin large amounts. It is prepared as follows:\nPreparation of 1. From sucrose (Cane sugar): If sucrose is boiled with dilute HCl or\nGlucose H SO in alcoholic solution, glucose and fructose are obtained in\n2 4\nequal amounts.\nChemistry 282\nReprint 2025-26\nC H O +H Ofi (cid:190)(cid:190)(cid:190) H+ C H O + C H O\n12 22 11 2 6 12 6 6 12 6\nSucrose Glucose Fructose\n2.

It is the\nStructure of\nmonomer of many of the larger carbohydrates, namely starch, cellulose.\nGlucose\nIt is probably the most abundant organic compound on earth. It was\nassigned the structure given below on the basis of the following\nevidences:\nCHO 1. Its molecular formula was found to be C H O .\n6 12 6\n2. On prolonged heating with HI, it forms n-hexane, suggesting that all\n(CHOH)\n4\nthe six carbon atoms are linked in a straight chain.\nCH OH\n2\nGlucose\n3. Glucose reacts with hydroxylamine to form an oxime and adds a\nmolecule of hydrogen cyanide to give cyanohydrin. These reactions\nconfirm the presence of a carbonyl group (>C = O) in glucose.\n4. Glucose gets oxidised to six carbon carboxylic acid (gluconic acid)\non reaction with a mild oxidising agent like bromine water. This\nindicates that the carbonyl group is present as an aldehydic group.\nCHO COOH\n(CHOH) Br 2 water (CHOH)\n4 4\nCH OH CH OH\n2 2\nGluconic acid\n5. Acetylation of glucose with acetic anhydride gives glucose\npentaacetate which confirms the presence of five –OH groups. Since\nit exists as a stable compound, five –OH groups should be attached\nto different carbon atoms.\n283 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\n6. On oxidation with nitric acid, glucose as well as gluconic acid both\nyield a dicarboxylic acid, saccharic acid. This indicates the presence\nof a primary alcoholic (–OH) group in glucose.\nCHO COOH COOH\n(CHOH) 4 Oxidation (CHOH) 4 Oxidation (CHOH) 4\nCH 2 OH COOH CH OH\n2\nSaccharic Gluconic\nacid acid\nThe exact spatial arrangement of different —OH groups was given\nby Fischer after studying many other properties.

It should be remembered that\n‘D’ and ‘L’ have no relation with the optical activity of the compound.\nThey are also not related to letter ‘d’ and ‘l’ (see Unit 6). The meaning\nof D– and L– notations is as follows.\nThe letters ‘D’ or ‘L’ before the name of any compound indicate the\nrelative configuration of a particular stereoisomer of a compound with\nrespect to configuration of some other compound, configuration of\nwhich is known. In the case of carbohydrates, this refers to their\nrelation with a particular isomer of glyceraldehyde. Glyceraldehyde\ncontains one asymmetric carbon atom and exists in two enantiomeric\nforms as shown below.\n(+) Isomer of glyceraldehyde has ‘D’ configuration. It means that when\nits structural formula is written on paper following specific conventions\nwhich you will study in higher classes, the –OH group lies on right hand\nside in the structure. All those compounds which can be chemically\ncorrelated to D (+) isomer of glyceraldehyde are said to have D-\nconfiguration whereas those which can be correlated to ‘L’ (–) isomer of\nglyceraldehyde are said to have L—configuration. In L (–) isomer –OH\ngroup is on left hand side as you can see in the structure. For assigning\nReprint 2025-26\nthe configuration of monosaccharides, it is the lowest asymmetric carbon\natom (as shown below) which is compared. As in (+) glucose, —OH on\nthe lowest asymmetric carbon is on the right side which is comparable\nto (+) glyceraldehyde, so (+) glucose is assigned D-configuration. Other\nasymmetric carbon atoms of glucose are not considered for this\ncomparison. Also, the structure of glucose and glyceraldehyde is written\nin a way that most oxidised carbon (in this case –CHO)is at the top.\nCHO\nH OH\n285 Biomolecules\nH O H\nCHO\nH OH\nH OH H OH\nCH 2 OH CH 2 OH\nD– (+) – Glyceraldehyde D–(+) – Glucose\nCyclic The structure (I) of glucose explained most of its properties but the\nStructure following reactions and facts could not be explained by this structure.\nof Glucose 1. Despite having the aldehyde group, glucose does not give Schiff’s\ntest and it does not form the hydrogensulphite addition product with\nNaHSO .\n3\n2. The pentaacetate of glucose does not react with hydroxylamine\nindicating the absence of free —CHO group.\n3. Glucose is found to exist in two different crystalline forms which are\nnamed as a and b. The a-form of glucose (m.p. 419 K) is obtained by\ncrystallisation from concentrated solution of glucose at 303 K while\nthe b-form (m.p. 423 K) is obtained by crystallisation from hot and\nsaturated aqueous solution at 371 K.\nThis behaviour could not be explained by the open chain structure\n(I) for glucose. It was proposed that one of the —OH groups may add\nto the —CHO group and form a cyclic hemiacetal structure. It was\nfound that glucose forms a six-membered ring in which —OH at C-5\nis involved in ring formation. This explains the absence of —CHO\ngroup and also existence of glucose in two forms as shown below.\nThese two cyclic forms exist in equilibrium with open chain structure.\nThe two cyclic hemiacetal forms of glucose differ only in the\nconfiguration of the hydroxyl group at C1, called anomeric carbon\nReprint 2025-26\n(the aldehyde carbon before cyclisation). Such isomers, i.e., a-form\nand b-form, are called anomers. The six membered cyclic structure\nof glucose is called pyranose structure (a– or b–), in analogy with\npyran. Pyran is a cyclic organic compound with one oxygen atom\nand five carbon atoms in the ring. The cyclic structure of glucose is\nmore correctly represented by Haworth structure as given below.\n10.1.2.2 Fructose Fructose is an important ketohexose. It is obtained along with glucose\nby the hydrolysis of disaccharide, sucrose. It is a natural\nmonosaccharide found in fruits, honey and vegetables. In its pure\nform it is used as a sweetner. It is also an important ketohexose.\nFructose also has the molecular formula C H O and\n6 12 6\nStructure on the basis of its reactions it was found to contain a\nof Fructose ketonic functional group at carbon number 2 and six\ncarbons in straight chain as in the case of glucose. It\nbelongs to D-series and is a laevorotatory compound.\nIt is appropriately written as D-(–)-fructose. Its open\nchain structure is as shown.\nIt also exists in two cyclic forms which are obtained\nby the addition of —OH at C5 to the ( ) group. The ring, thus formed\nis a five membered ring and is named as furanose with analogy to the\ncompound furan. Furan is a five membered cyclic compound with one\noxygen and four carbon atoms.\nThe cyclic structures of two anomers of fructose are represented by\nHaworth structures as given.\nChemistry 286\nReprint 2025-26\n10.1.3 You have already read that disaccharides on hydrolysis with dilute\nDisaccharides acids or enzymes yield two molecules of either the same or different\nmonosaccharides. The two monosaccharides are joined together by an\noxide linkage formed by the loss of a water molecule. Such a linkage\nbetween two monosaccharide units through oxygen atom is called\nglycosidic linkage.\nIn disaccharides, if the reducing groups of monosaccharides i.e.,\naldehydic or ketonic groups are bonded, these are non-reducing sugars,\ne.g., sucrose. On the other hand, sugars in which these functional groups\nare free, are called reducing sugars, for example, maltose and lactose.\n(i) Sucrose: One of the common disaccharides is sucrose which on\nhydrolysis gives equimolar mixture of D-(+)-glucose and D-(-) fructose.\nThese two monosaccharides are held together by a glycosidic\nlinkage between C1 of a-D-glucose and C2 of b-D-fructose. Since\nthe reducing groups of glucose and fructose are involved in\nglycosidic bond formation, sucrose is a non reducing sugar.\nSucrose is dextrorotatory but after hydrolysis gives\ndextrorotatory glucose and laevorotatory fructose. Since the\nlaevorotation of fructose (–92.4°) is more than dextrorotation of\nglucose (+ 52.5°), the mixture is laevorotatory. Thus, hydrolysis of\nsucrose brings about a change in the sign of rotation, from dextro\n(+) to laevo (–) and the product is named as invert sugar.\n(ii) Maltose: Another disaccharide, maltose is composed of two\na-D-glucose units in which C1 of one glucose (I) is linked to C4\nof another glucose unit (II). The free aldehyde group can be\nproduced at C1 of second glucose in solution and it shows reducing\nproperties so it is a reducing sugar.\n287 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\n(iii) Lactose: It is more commonly known as milk sugar since this\ndisaccharide is found in milk. It is composed of b-D-galactose and\nb-D-glucose. The linkage is between C1 of galactose and C4 of\nglucose. Free aldehyde group may be produced at C-1 of glucose\nunit, hence it is also a reducing sugar.\n10.1.4\nPolysaccharides Polysaccharides contain a large number of monosaccharide units joined\ntogether by glycosidic linkages. These are the most commonly\nencountered carbohydrates in nature. They mainly act as the food\nstorage or structural materials.\n(i) Starch: Starch is the main storage polysaccharide of plants. It is\nthe most important dietary source for human beings. High content\nof starch is found in cereals, roots, tubers and some vegetables. It\nis a polymer of a-glucose and consists of two components—\nAmylose and Amylopectin. Amylose is water soluble component\nwhich constitutes about 15-20% of starch. Chemically amylose is\na long unbranched chain with 200-1000 a-D-(+)-glucose units\nheld together by C1– C4 glycosidic linkage.\nAmylopectin is insoluble in water and constitutes about 80-\n85% of starch. It is a branched chain polymer of a-D-glucose\nunits in which chain is formed by C1–C4 glycosidic linkage whereas\nbranching occurs by C1–C6 glycosidic linkage.\nChemistry 288\nReprint 2025-26\n(ii) Cellulose: Cellulose occurs exclusively in plants and it is the most\nabundant organic substance in plant kingdom. It is a predominant\nconstituent of cell wall of plant cells. Cellulose is a straight chain\npolysaccharide composed only of b-D-glucose units which are\njoined by glycosidic linkage between C1 of one glucose unit and\nC4 of the next glucose unit.\n(iii) Glycogen: The carbohydrates are stored in animal body as glycogen.\nIt is also known as animal starch because its structure is similar to\namylopectin and is rather more highly branched. It is present in liver,\nmuscles and brain. When the body needs glucose, enzymes break the\nglycogen down to glucose. Glycogen is also found in yeast and fungi.\n10.1.5 Carbohydrates are essential for life in both plants and animals. They\nImportance of form a major portion of our food. Honey has been used for a long time\nCarbohydrates as an instant source of energy by ‘Vaids’ in ayurvedic system of\nmedicine. Carbohydrates are used as storage molecules as starch in\nplants and glycogen in animals. Cell wall of bacteria and plants is\nmade up of cellulose. We build furniture, etc. from cellulose in the form\n289 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\nof wood and clothe ourselves with cellulose in the form of cotton fibre.\nThey provide raw materials for many important industries like textiles,\npaper, lacquers and breweries.\nTwo aldopentoses viz. D-ribose and 2-deoxy-D-ribose (Section\n10.5.1, Class XII) are present in nucleic acids. Carbohydrates are found\nin biosystem in combination with many proteins and lipids.\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n10.1 Glucose or sucrose are soluble in water but cyclohexane or\nbenzene (simple six membered ring compounds) are insoluble in\nwater.

They are also required for\ngrowth and maintenance of body. The word protein is derived from\nGreek word, “proteios” which means primary or of prime importance.\nAll proteins are polymers of a-amino acids.\n10.2.1 Amino Amino acids contain amino (–NH 2 ) and carboxyl (–COOH) functional\ngroups. Depending upon the relative position of amino group with\nAcids\nrespect to carboxyl group, the amino acids can be\nR CH COOH\nclassified as a, b, g, d and so on. Only a-amino\nacids are obtained on hydrolysis of proteins. They NH\n2\nmay contain other functional groups also. a-amino acid\nAll a-amino acids have trivial names, which (R = side chain)\nusually reflect the property of that compound or\nits source. Glycine is so named since it has sweet taste (in Greek glykos\nmeans sweet) and tyrosine was first obtained from cheese (in Greek, tyros\nmeans cheese.) Amino acids are generally represented by a three letter\nsymbol, sometimes one letter symbol is also used. Structures of some\ncommonly occurring amino acids along with their 3-letter and 1-letter\nsymbols are given in Table 10.2.\nCOOH\nTable 10.2: Natural Amino Acids H N H\n2\nR\nName of the Characteristic feature Three letter One letter\namino acids of side chain, R symbol code\n1.

The\namino acids, which can be synthesised in the body, are known as non-\nessential amino acids. On the other hand, those which cannot be\nsynthesised in the body and must be obtained through diet, are known\nas essential amino acids (marked with asterisk in Table10.2).\n291 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\nAmino acids are usually colourless, crystalline solids. These are\nwater-soluble, high melting solids and behave like salts rather than\nsimple amines or carboxylic acids. This behaviour is due to the presence\nof both acidic (carboxyl group) and basic (amino\ngroup) groups in the same molecule. In aqueous\nsolution, the carboxyl group can lose a proton\nand amino group can accept a proton, giving rise\nto a dipolar ion known as zwitter ion. This is\nneutral but contains both positive and negative\ncharges.\nIn zwitter ionic form, amino acids show amphoteric behaviour as\nthey react both with acids and bases.\nExcept glycine, all other naturally occurring a-amino acids are\noptically active, since the a-carbon atom is asymmetric. These exist\nboth in ‘D’ and ‘L’ forms. Most naturally occurring amino acids have\nL-configuration. L-Aminoacids are represented by writing the –NH group\n2\non left hand side.\n10.2.3 Structure You have already read that proteins are the polymers of a-amino acids\nof Proteins and they are connected to each other by peptide bond or peptide\nlinkage. Chemically, peptide linkage is an amide formed between\n–COOH group and –NH group. The reaction between two molecules of\n2\nsimilar or different amino acids, proceeds through\nthe combination of the amino group of one molecule\nwith the carboxyl group of the other. This results in\nthe elimination of a water molecule and formation of\na peptide bond –CO–NH–. The product of the reaction\nis called a dipeptide because it is made up of two\namino acids. For example, when carboxyl group of\nglycine combines with the amino group of alanine\nwe get a dipeptide, glycylalanine.\nIf a third amino acid combines to a dipeptide, the product is called a\ntripeptide. A tripeptide contains three amino acids linked by two peptide\nlinkages. Similarly when four, five or six amino acids are linked, the respective\nproducts are known as tetrapeptide, pentapeptide or hexapeptide,\nrespectively. When the number of such amino acids is more than ten, then\nthe products are called polypeptides. A polypeptide with more than hundred\namino acid residues, having molecular mass higher than 10,000u is called\na protein. However, the distinction between a polypeptide and a protein is\nnot very sharp. Polypeptides with fewer amino acids are likely to be called\nproteins if they ordinarily have a well defined conformation of a protein such\nas insulin which contains 51 amino acids.\nProteins can be classified into two types on the basis of their\nmolecular shape.\n(a) Fibrous proteins\nWhen the polypeptide chains run parallel and are held together by\nhydrogen and disulphide bonds, then fibre– like structure is formed. Such\nproteins are generally insoluble in water. Some common examples are\nkeratin (present in hair, wool, silk) and myosin (present in muscles), etc.\nChemistry 292\nReprint 2025-26\n(b) Globular proteins\nThis structure results when the chains of polypeptides coil around\nto give a spherical shape. These are usually soluble in water. Insulin\nand albumins are the common examples of globular proteins.\nStructure and shape of proteins can be studied at four different\nlevels, i.e., primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary, each level\nbeing more complex than the previous one.\n(i) Primary structure of proteins: Proteins may have\none or more polypeptide chains. Each polypeptide in a\nprotein has amino acids linked with each other in a\nspecific sequence and it is this sequence of amino acids\nthat is said to be the primary structure of that protein.\nAny change in this primary structure i.e., the sequence\nof amino acids creates a different protein.\n(ii) Secondary structure of proteins: The secondary\nstructure of protein refers to the shape in which a long\npolypeptide chain can exist. They are found to exist in\ntwo different types of structures viz. a-helix and\nb-pleated sheet structure. These structures arise due\nto the regular folding of the backbone of the polypeptide\nchain due to hydrogen bonding between and\n–NH– groups of the peptide bond.\na-Helix is one of the most common ways in which\na polypeptide chain forms all possible hydrogen bonds\nby twisting into a right handed screw (helix) with the\n–NH group of each amino acid residue hydrogen bonded to the\nFig. 10.1: a-Helix\nstructure of proteins C O of an adjacent turn of the helix as shown in Fig.10.1.\nIn b-pleated sheet structure all peptide chains are\nstretched out to nearly maximum extension and then\nlaid side by side which are held together by\nintermolecular hydrogen bonds. The structure resembles\nthe pleated folds of drapery and therefore is known as\nb-pleated sheet.\n(iii)Tertiary structure of proteins: The tertiary\nstructure of proteins represents overall folding of the\npolypeptide chains i.e., further folding of the secondary\nstructure. It gives rise to two major molecular shapes\nviz. fibrous and globular. The main forces which\nstabilise the 2° and 3° structures of proteins are\nhydrogen bonds, disulphide linkages, van der Waals\nand electrostatic forces of attraction.\nFig. 10.2: b-Pleated sheet structure of (iv) Quaternary structure of proteins: Some of the\nproteins proteins are composed of two or more polypeptide\nchains referred to as sub-units. The spatial\narrangement of these subunits with respect to each\nother is known as quaternary structure.\n293 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\nA diagrammatic representation of all these four structures is\ngiven in Figure 10.3 where each coloured ball represents an\namino acid.\nFig. 10.3: Diagrammatic representation of protein structure (two sub-units\nof two types in quaternary structure)\nFig. 10.4: Primary,\nsecondary, tertiary\nand quaternary\nstructures of\nhaemoglobin\n10.2.4 Protein found in a biological system with a unique three-dimensional\nDenaturation of structure and biological activity is called a native protein. When a\nProteins protein in its native form, is subjected to physical change like change\nin temperature or chemical change like change in pH, the hydrogen\nbonds are disturbed. Due to this, globules unfold and helix get uncoiled\nand protein loses its biological activity. This is called denaturation of\nChemistry 294\nReprint 2025-26\nprotein. During denaturation secondary and tertiary structures are\ndestroyed but primary structure remains intact. The coagulation of\negg white on boiling is a common example of denaturation. Another\nexample is curdling of milk which is caused due to the formation of\nlactic acid by the bacteria present in milk.\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n10.4 The melting points and solubility in water of amino acids are generally\nhigher than that of the corresponding halo acids.

An example is the digestion of food, absorption of\nappropriate molecules and ultimately production of energy. This process\ninvolves a sequence of reactions and all these reactions occur in the\nbody under very mild conditions. This occurs with the help of certain\nbiocatalysts called enzymes. Almost all the enzymes are globular\nproteins. Enzymes are very specific for a particular reaction and for a\nparticular substrate. They are generally named after the compound or\nclass of compounds upon which they work. For example, the enzyme\nthat catalyses hydrolysis of maltose into glucose is named as maltase.\nMaltase\nC H O  2C H O\n12 22 11 6 12 6\nMaltose Glucose\nSometimes enzymes are also named after the reaction, where they\nare used. For example, the enzymes which catalyse the oxidation of\none substrate with simultaneous reduction of another substrate are\nnamed as oxidoreductase enzymes. The ending of the name of an\nenzyme is -ase.\n10.3.1 Mechanism\nEnzymes are needed only in small quantities for the progress of a reaction.\nof Enzyme\nSimilar to the action of chemical catalysts, enzymes are said to reduce\nAction\nthe magnitude of activation energy. For example, activation energy for\nacid hydrolysis of sucrose is 6.22 kJ mol–1, while the activation energy is\nonly 2.15 kJ mol–1 when hydrolysed by the enzyme, sucrase. Mechanism\nfor the enzyme action has been discussed.\n1111100000.....44444 VVVVViiiiitttttaaaaammmmmiiiiinnnnnsssss\nIt has been observed that certain organic compounds are required in\nsmall amounts in our diet but their deficiency causes specific diseases.\nThese compounds are called vitamins. Most of the vitamins cannot be\nsynthesised in our body but plants can synthesise almost all of them,\nso they are considered as essential food factors. However, the bacteria\nof the gut can produce some of the vitamins required by us. All the\nvitamins are generally available in our diet. Different vitamins belong\nto various chemical classes and it is difficult to define them on the\nbasis of structure. They are generally regarded as organic compounds\nrequired in the diet in small amounts to perform specific\nbiological functions for normal maintenance of optimum growth\n295 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\nand health of the organism. Vitamins are designated by alphabets\nA, B, C, D, etc. Some of them are further named as sub-groups e.g. B ,\n1\nB , B , B , etc. Excess of vitamins is also harmful and vitamin pills\n2 6 12\nshould not be taken without the advice of doctor.\nThe term “Vitamine” was coined from the word vital + amine since\nthe earlier identified compounds had amino groups. Later work showed\nthat most of them did not contain amino groups, so the letter ‘e’ was\ndropped and the term vitamin is used these days.\n10.4.1 Vitamins are classified into two groups depending upon their solubility\nClassification of in water or fat.\nVitamins (i) Fat soluble vitamins: Vitamins which are soluble in fat and oils\nbut insoluble in water are kept in this group. These are vitamins A,\nD, E and K. They are stored in liver and adipose (fat storing) tissues.\n(ii) Water soluble vitamins: B group vitamins and vitamin C are soluble\nin water so they are grouped together. Water soluble vitamins must\nbe supplied regularly in diet because they are readily excreted in\nurine and cannot be stored (except vitamin B ) in our body.\n12\nSome important vitamins, their sources and diseases caused by\ntheir deficiency are listed in Table 10.3.\nTable 10.3: Some important Vitamins, their Sources and their\nDeficiency Diseases\nSl.

How are these characteristics transmitted from one\ngeneration to the next? It has been observed that nucleus of a living\ncell is responsible for this transmission of inherent characters, also\ncalled heredity. The particles in nucleus of the cell, responsible for\nheredity, are called chromosomes which are made up of proteins and\nanother type of biomolecules called nucleic acids. These are mainly\nof two types, the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid\n(RNA). Since nucleic acids are long chain polymers of nucleotides, so\nthey are also called polynucleotides.\nJames Dewey Watson\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois, in 1928, Dr Watson received his Ph.D.\n(1950) from Indiana University in Zoology. He is best known for\nhis discovery of the structure of DNA for which he shared with\nFrancis Crick and Maurice Wilkins the 1962 Nobel prize in\nPhysiology and Medicine. They proposed that DNA molecule takes\nthe shape of a double helix, an elegantly simple structure that\nresembles a gently twisted ladder. The rails of the ladder are\nmade of alternating units of phosphate and the sugar deoxyribose;\nthe rungs are each composed of a pair of purine/ pyrimidine bases. This\nresearch laid the foundation for the emerging field of molecular biology. The\ncomplementary pairing of nucleotide bases explains how identical copies of\nparental DNA pass on to two daughter cells. This research launched a revolution\nin biology that led to modern recombinant DNA techniques.\n10.5.1 Chemical Complete hydrolysis of DNA (or RNA) yields a pentose sugar, phosphoric\nComposition acid and nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds (called bases). In\nof Nucleic DNA molecules, the sugar moiety is b-D-2-deoxyribose whereas in\nAcids RNA molecule, it is b-D-ribose.\n297 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\nDNA contains four bases viz. adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C)\nand thymine (T). RNA also contains four bases, the first three bases are\nsame as in DNA but the fourth one is uracil (U).\nCytosine (C) Thymine (T) Uracil (U)\n10.5.2 Structure A unit formed by the attachment of a base to 1¢ position of sugar is\nof Nucleic known as nucleoside. In nucleosides, the sugar carbons are numbered\nAcids as 1¢, 2¢, 3¢, etc. in order to distinguish these from the bases\n(Fig. 10.5a). When nucleoside is linked to phosphoric acid at 5¢-position\nof sugar moiety, we get a nucleotide (Fig. 10.5).\nFig. 10.5: Structure of (a) a nucleoside and (b) a nucleotide\nNucleotides are joined together by phosphodiester linkage between\n5¢ and 3¢ carbon atoms of the pentose sugar.

Nucleic acids\nhave a secondary structure also. James Watson and Francis Crick\ngave a double strand helix structure for DNA (Fig. 10.7). Two\nnucleic acid chains are wound about each other and held together\nby hydrogen bonds between pairs of bases. The two strands are\ncomplementary to each other because the hydrogen bonds are\nformed between specific pairs of bases. Adenine forms hydrogen\nbonds with thymine whereas cytosine forms hydrogen bonds\nwith guanine.\nIn secondary structure of RNA single stranded helics is present\nwhich sometimes foldsback on itself. RNA molecules are of three\ntypes and they perform different functions. They are named as\nmessenger RNA (m-RNA), ribosomal RNA (r-RNA) and transfer\nRNA (t-RNA).\nFig. 10.7: Double strand helix structure for DNA\n299 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\nHar Gobind Khorana\nHar Gobind Khorana, was born in 1922. He obtained his M.Sc.\ndegree from Punjab University in Lahore. He worked with Professor\nVladimir Prelog, who moulded Khorana’s thought and philosophy\ntowards science, work and effort. After a brief stay in India in\n1949, Khorana went back to England and worked with Professor\nG.W. Kenner and Professor A.R.Todd. It was at Cambridge, U.K.\nthat he got interested in both proteins and nucleic acids. Dr Khorana shared the\nNobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology in 1968 with Marshall Nirenberg and Robert\nHolley for cracking the genetic code.\nDNA Fingerprinting\nIt is known that every individual has unique fingerprints. These occur at the tips of\nthe fingers and have been used for identification for a long time but these can be\naltered by surgery. A sequence of bases on DNA is also unique for a person and\ninformation regarding this is called DNA fingerprinting. It is same for every cell and\ncannot be altered by any known treatment. DNA fingerprinting is now used\n(i) in forensic laboratories for identification of criminals.\n(ii) to determine paternity of an individual.\n(iii) to identify the dead bodies in any accident by comparing the DNA’s of parents or\nchildren.\n(iv) to identify racial groups to rewrite biological evolution.\n10.5.3 Biological DNA is the chemical basis of heredity and may be regarded as the reserve\nFunctions of genetic information. DNA is exclusively responsible for maintaining\nof Nucleic the identity of different species of organisms over millions of years. A\nAcids DNA molecule is capable of self duplication during cell division and\nidentical DNA strands are transferred to daughter cells. Another important\nfunction of nucleic acids is the protein synthesis in the cell. Actually, the\nproteins are synthesised by various RNA molecules in the cell but the\nmessage for the synthesis of a particular protein is present in DNA.\n1111100000.....66666 HHHHHooooorrrrrmmmmmooooonnnnneeeeesssss Hormones are molecules that act as intercellular messengers. These\nare produced by endocrine glands in the body and are poured directly\nin the blood stream which transports them to the site of action.\nIn terms of chemical nature, some of these are steroids, e.g., estrogens\nand androgens; some are poly peptides for example insulin and\nendorphins and some others are amino acid derivatives such as\nepinephrine and norepinephrine.\nHormones have several functions in the body. They help to maintain\nthe balance of biological activities in the body. The role of insulin in keeping\nthe blood glucose level within the narrow limit is an example of this\nfunction. Insulin is released in response to the rapid rise in blood glucose\nlevel. On the other hand hormone glucagon tends to increase the glucose\nlevel in the blood. The two hormones together regulate the glucose level\nin the blood. Epinephrine and norepinephrine mediate responses to\nexternal stimuli. Growth hormones and sex hormones play role in growth\nand development. Thyroxine produced in the thyroid gland is an iodinated\nderivative of amino acid tyrosine. Abnormally low level of thyroxine leads\nChemistry 300\nReprint 2025-26\nto hypothyroidism which is characterised by lethargyness and obesity.\nIncreased level of thyroxine causes hyperthyroidism. Low level of iodine\nin the diet may lead to hypothyroidism and enlargement of the thyroid\ngland. This condition is largely being controlled by adding sodium iodide\nto commercial table salt (“Iodised” salt).\nSteroid hormones are produced by adrenal cortex and gonads (testes\nin males and ovaries in females). Hormones released by the adrenal cortex\nplay very important role in the functions of the body. For example,\nglucocorticoids control the carbohydrate metabolism, modulate\ninflammatory reactions, and are involved in reactions to stress. The\nmineralocorticoids control the level of excretion of water and salt by the\nkidney. If adrenal cortex does not function properly then one of the results\nmay be Addison’s disease characterised by hypoglycemia, weakness and\nincreased susceptibility to stress. The disease is fatal unless it is treated by\nglucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. Hormones released by gonads are\nresponsible for development of secondary sex characters. Testosterone is\nthe major sex hormone produced in males. It is responsible for development\nof secondary male characteristics (deep voice, facial hair, general physical\nconstitution) and estradiol is the main female sex hormone. It is responsible\nfor development of secondary female characteristics and participates in\nthe control of menstrual cycle. Progesterone is responsible for preparing\nthe uterus for implantation of fertilised egg.\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n10.6 Why cannot vitamin C be stored in our body?\n10.7 What products would be formed when a nucleotide from DNA containing\nthymine is hydrolysed?\n10.8 When RNA is hydrolysed, there is no relationship among the quantities of different\nbases obtained. What does this fact suggest about the structure of RNA?\nSSSSSuuuuummmmmmmmmmaaaaarrrrryyyyy\nCarbohydrates are optically active polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones or molecules which\nprovide such units on hydrolysis. They are broadly classified into three groups —\nmonosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides. Glucose, the most important\nsource of energy for mammals, is obtained by the digestion of starch. Monosaccharides\nare held together by glycosidic linkages to form disaccharides or polysaccharides.\nProteins are the polymers of about twenty different aaaaa-amino acids which are\nlinked by peptide bonds. Ten amino acids are called essential amino acids because\nthey cannot be synthesised by our body, hence must be provided through diet. Proteins\nperform various structural and dynamic functions in the organisms. Proteins which\ncontain only a-amino acids are called simple proteins. The secondary or tertiary\nstructure of proteins get disturbed on change of pH or temperature and they are not\nable to perform their functions. This is called denaturation of proteins. Enzymes are\nbiocatalysts which speed up the reactions in biosystems. They are very specific and\nselective in their action and chemically majority of enzymes are proteins.\nVitamins are accessory food factors required in the diet. They are classified as\nfat soluble (A, D, E and K) and water soluble (B group and C). Deficiency of vitamins\nleads to many diseases.\n301 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\nNucleic acids are the polymers of nucleotides which in turn consist of a base,\na pentose sugar and phosphate moiety. Nucleic acids are responsible for the transfer\nof characters from parents to offsprings. There are two types of nucleic acids —\nDNA and RNA. DNA contains a five carbon sugar molecule called 2-deoxyribose\nwhereas RNA contains ribose. Both DNA and RNA contain adenine, guanine and\ncytosine. The fourth base is thymine in DNA and uracil in RNA. The structure of\nDNA is a double strand whereas RNA is a single strand molecule.

Therefore, it is detail.\nBalancing a chemical equation\nAccording to the law of conservation of mass, a balanced chemical equation has the same number of\natoms of each element on both sides of the equation. Many chemical equations can be balanced by\ntrial and error. Let us take the reactions of a few metals and non-metals with oxygen to give oxides\n4 Fe(s) + 3O (g) → 2Fe O (s) (a) balanced equation\n2 2 3\n2 Mg(s) + O (g) → 2MgO(s) (b) balanced equation\n2\nP (s) + O (g) → P O (s) (c) unbalanced equation\n4 2 4 10\nEquations (a) and (b) are balanced, since there are same number of metal and oxygen atoms on\neach side of the equations. However equation (c) is not balanced. In this equation, phosphorus\natoms are balanced but not the oxygen atoms. To balance it, we must place the coefficient 5 on\nthe left of oxygen on the left side of the equation to balance the oxygen atoms appearing on the\nright side of the equation.\nP (s) + 5O (g) → P O (s) balanced equation\n4 2 4 10\nNow, let us take combustion of propane, C H . This equation can be balanced in steps.\n3 8\nStep 1 Write down the correct formulas of reactants and products. Here, propane and oxygen are\nreactants, and carbon dioxide and water are products.\nC H (g) + O (g) → CO (g) + H O(l) unbalanced equation\n3 8 2 2 2\nStep 2 Balance the number of C atoms: Since 3 carbon atoms are in the reactant, therefore, three\nCO molecules are required on the right side.\n2\nC H (g) + O (g) → 3CO (g) + H O (l)\n3 8 2 2 2\nStep 3 Balance the number of H atoms: on the left there are 8 hydrogen atoms in the reactants\nhowever, each molecule of water has two hydrogen atoms, so four molecules of water will be\nrequired for eight hydrogen atoms on the right side.\nC H (g) +O (g) → 3CO (g)+4H O (l)\n3 8 2 2 2\nStep 4 Balance the number of O atoms: There are 10 oxygen atoms on the right side (3 × 2 = 6 in\nCO and 4×1= 4 in water). Therefore, five O molecules are needed to supply the required 10 CO\n2 2 2\nand 4×1= 4 in water). Therefore, five O molecules are needed to supply the required 10 oxygen\n2\natoms.\nC H (g) +5O (g) → 3CO (g) + 4H O (l)\n3 8 2 2 2\nStep 5 Verify that the number of atoms of each element is balanced in the final equation. The\nequation shows three carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and 10 oxygen atoms on each side.\nAll equations that have correct formulas for all reactants and products can be balanced. Always\nremember that subscripts in formulas of reactants and products cannot be changed to balance\nan equation.\nReprint 2025-26\nUnit 1.indd 21 9/9/2022 4:27:36 PM\n22 chemistry\nproblem 1.3 the limiting reagent in the production of\nNH in this situation.\nCalculate the amount of water (g) 3\nproduced by the combustion of 16 g Solution\nof methane.\nA balanced equation for the above\nSolution reaction is written as follows :\nThe balanced equation for the\ncombustion of methane is :\nCH (g) + 2O (g) → CO (g) + 2H O (g) Calculation of moles :\n4 2 2 2\n(i) 16 g of CH corresponds to one mole.

People in ancient India,\nalready had the knowledge of many scientific phenomenon much before the advent of\nmodern science. They applied the knowledge in various walks of life.\nThe study of chemistry is very important as its domain encompasses every sphere\nof life. Chemists study the properties and structure of substances and the changes\nundergone by them. All substances contain matter, which can exist in three states –\nsolid, liquid or gas. The constituent particles are held in different ways in these states\nof matter and they exhibit their characteristic properties. Matter can also be classified\ninto elements, compounds or mixtures. An element contains particles of only one type,\nwhich may be atoms or molecules. The compounds are formed where atoms of two or\nmore elements combine in a fixed ratio to each other. Mixtures occur widely and many\nof the substances present around us are mixtures.\nWhen the properties of a substance are studied, measurement is inherent. The\nquantification of properties requires a system of measurement and units in which the\nquantities are to be expressed. Many systems of measurement exist, of which the English\nReprint 2025-26\nUnit 1.indd 24 11/30/2022 14:49:36\nSome BaSic conceptS of chemiStry 25\nand the Metric Systems are widely used. The scientific community, however, has agreed to\nhave a uniform and common system throughout the world, which is abbreviated as SI units\n(International System of Units).\nSince measurements involve recording of data, which are always associated with a certain\namount of uncertainty, the proper handling of data obtained by measuring the quantities\nis very important. The measurements of quantities in chemistry are spread over a wide\nrange of 10–31 to 10+23. Hence, a convenient system of expressing the numbers in scientific\nnotation is used. The uncertainty is taken care of by specifying the number of significant\nfigures, in which the observations are reported. The dimensional analysis helps to express\nthe measured quantities in different systems of units. Hence, it is possible to interconvert\nthe results from one system of units to another.\nThe combination of different atoms is governed by basic laws of chemical combination\n— these being the law of conservation of mass, Law of Definite Proportions, Law of\nmultiple proportions, Gay lussac’s law of Gaseous volumes and avogadro law. All\nthese laws led to the Dalton’s atomic theory, which states that atoms are building blocks\nof matter. The atomic mass of an element is expressed relative to 12C isotope of carbon,\nwhich has an exact value of 12u. Usually, the atomic mass used for an element is the\naverage atomic mass obtained by taking into account the natural abundance of different\nisotopes of that element. The molecular mass of a molecule is obtained by taking sum of\nthe atomic masses of different atoms present in a molecule. The molecular formula can be\ncalculated by determining the mass per cent of different elements present in a compound\nand its molecular mass.\nThe number of atoms, molecules or any other particles present in a given system are\nexpressed in the terms of avogadro constant (6.022 × 1023). This is known as 1 mol of the\nrespective particles or entities.\nChemical reactions represent the chemical changes undergone by different elements and\ncompounds. A balanced chemical equation provides a lot of information. The coefficients\nindicate the molar ratios and the respective number of particles taking part in a particular\nreaction. The quantitative study of the reactants required or the products formed is called\nstoichiometry. Using stoichiometric calculations, the amount of one or more reactant(s)\nrequired to produce a particular amount of product can be determined and vice-versa. The\namount of substance present in a given volume of a solution is expressed in number of ways,\ne.g., mass per cent, mole fraction, molarity and molality.\nexerciSeS\n1.1 Calculate the molar mass of the following:\n(i) H O (ii) CO (iii) CH\n2 2 4\n1.2 Calculate the mass per cent of different elements present in sodium sulphate\n(Na SO ).\n2 4\n1.3 Determine the empirical formula of an oxide of iron, which has 69.9% iron and\n30.1% dioxygen by mass.\n1.4 Calculate the amount of carbon dioxide that could be produced when\n(i) 1 mole of carbon is burnt in air.\n(ii) 1 mole of carbon is burnt in 16 g of dioxygen.\n(iii) 2 moles of carbon are burnt in 16 g of dioxygen.\n1.5 Calculate the mass of sodium acetate (CH COONa) required to make 500 mL of\n3\n0.375 molar aqueous solution.

Also, when the\nsurface of an object is irradiated with light\n(electromagnetic radiation), a part of radiant\nenergy is generally reflected as such, a part Fig. 2.8 Wavelength-intensity relationship\nis absorbed and a part of it is transmitted.\nThe reason for incomplete absorption is\nthat ordinary objects are as a rule imperfect\nabsorbers of radiation. An ideal body, which\nemits and absorbs radiations of all frequencies\nuniformly, is called a black body and the\nradiation emitted by such a body is called\nblack body radiation. In practice, no such\nbody exists. Carbon black approximates\nfairly closely to black body. A good physical\napproximation to a black body is a cavity with a\ntiny hole, which has no other opening.

It is\ncharacterized by three quantum numbers (n, l and m) and its value depends upon the coordinates\nl\nof the electron. ψ has, by itself, no physical meaning. It is the square of the wave function i.e., |ψ|2\nwhich has a physical meaning. |ψ|2 at any point in an atom gives the value of probability density\nat that point. Probability density (|ψ|2) is the probability per unit volume and the product of |ψ|2\nand a small volume (called a volume element) yields the probability of finding the electron in that\nvolume (the reason for specifying a small volume element is that |ψ|2 varies from one region to\nanother in space but its value can be assumed to be constant within a small volume element).\nThe total probability of finding the electron in a given volume can then be calculated by the sum\nof all the products of |ψ|2 and the corresponding volume elements.

Starting from The number of electrons to be filled in various\norbitals is restricted by the exclusion principle,\ngiven by the Austrian scientist Wolfgang Pauli\n(1926). According to this principle : No two\nelectrons in an atom can have the same set\nof four quantum numbers. Pauli exclusion\nprinciple can also be stated as : “Only two\nelectrons may exist in the same orbital and\nthese electrons must have opposite spin.”\nThis means that the two electrons can have\nthe same value of three quantum numbers\nn, l and m, but must have the opposite spin\nl\nquantum number. The restriction imposed\nby Pauli’s exclusion principle on the number\nof electrons in an orbital helps in calculating\nthe capacity of electrons to be present in any\nsubshell. For example, subshell 1s comprises\none orbital and thus the maximum number of\nelectrons present in 1s subshell can be two, in\np and d subshells, the maximum number of\nelectrons can be 6 and 10 and so on. This can\nbe summed up as : the maximum number\nof electrons in the shell with principal\nquantum number n is equal to 2n2.\nHund’s Rule of Maximum Multiplicity\nThis rule deals with the filling of electrons into\nthe orbitals belonging to the same subshell\n(that is, orbitals of equal energy, called\nFig.2.17 Order of filling of orbitals\ndegenerate orbitals).

The completely filled\nor half filled subshells have symmetrical\ndistribution of electrons in them and\nare therefore more stable. Electrons in\nthe same subshell (here 3d) have equal\nenergy but different spatial distribution.\nConsequently, their shielding of one-\nanother is relatively small and the\nelectrons are more strongly attracted by\nthe nucleus.\n2. Exchange Energy : The stabilizing\neffect arises whenever two or more\nelectrons with the same spin are present\nin the degenerate orbitals of a subshell.\nThese electrons tend to exchange their\npositions and the energy released due to\nthis exchange is called exchange energy.\nThe number of exchanges that can take\nplace is maximum when the subshell\nis either half filled or completely filled\n(Fig. 2.18). As a result the exchange\nenergy is maximum and so is the stability.\nYou may note that the exchange\nenergy is at the basis of Hund’s rule\nthat electrons which enter orbitals of\nequal energy have parallel spins as far\nas possible. In other words, the extra\nstability of half-filled and completely filled\nsubshell is due to: (i) relatively small\nshielding, (ii) smaller coulombic repulsion\nenergy, and (iii) larger exchange energy.\nDetails about the exchange energy will be Fig. 2.18 Possible exchange for a d5\nconfiguration\ndealt with in higher classes.\nReprint 2025-26\nUnit 2.indd 65 9/9/2022 4:28:21 PM\n66 chemistry\nTable 2.6 Electronic Configurations of the Elements\n* Elements with exceptional electronic configurations\nReprint 2025-26\nUnit 2.indd 66 9/9/2022 4:28:22 PM\nstructure of atom 67\n** Elements with atomic number 112 and above have been reported but not yet fully authenticated and named.\nReprint 2025-26\nUnit 2.indd 67 9/9/2022 4:28:23 PM\n68 chemistry\nsUmmary\natoms are the building blocks of elements. They are the smallest parts of an element that\nchemically react. The first atomic theory, proposed by John Dalton in 1808, regarded atom as\nthe ultimate indivisible particle of matter. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, it was\nproved experimentally that atoms are divisible and consist of three fundamental particles:\nelectrons, protons and neutrons. The discovery of sub-atomic particles led to the proposal\nof various atomic models to explain the structure of atom.\nThomson in 1898 proposed that an atom consists of uniform sphere of positive electricity\nwith electrons embedded into it. This model in which mass of the atom is considered to\nbe evenly spread over the atom was proved wrong by Rutherford’s famous alpha-particle\nscattering experiment in 1909. Rutherford concluded that atom is made of a tiny positively\ncharged nucleus, at its centre with electrons revolving around it in circular orbits.\nrutherford model, which resembles the solar system, was no doubt an improvement over\nthomson model but it could not account for the stability of the atom i.e., why the electron\ndoes not fall into the nucleus. Further, it was also silent about the electronic structure of\natoms i.e., about the distribution and relative energies of electrons around the nucleus. The\ndifficulties of the Rutherford model were overcome by Niels Bohr in 1913 in his model of the\nhydrogen atom. Bohr postulated that electron moves around the nucleus in circular orbits.\nOnly certain orbits can exist and each orbit corresponds to a specific energy. Bohr calculated\nthe energy of electron in various orbits and for each orbit predicted the distance between the\nelectron and nucleus. bohr model, though offering a satisfactory model for explaining the\nspectra of the hydrogen atom, could not explain the spectra of multi-electron atoms. The\nreason for this was soon discovered. In Bohr model, an electron is regarded as a charged\nparticle moving in a well defined circular orbit about the nucleus. The wave character of\nthe electron is ignored in Bohr’s theory. An orbit is a clearly defined path and this path can\ncompletely be defined only if both the exact position and the exact velocity of the electron\nat the same time are known. This is not possible according to the Heisenberg uncertainty\nprinciple. Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only ignores the dual behaviour\nof electron but also contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\nErwin Schrödinger, in 1926, proposed an equation called Schrödinger equation to\ndescribe the electron distributions in space and the allowed energy levels in atoms. This\nequation incorporates de Broglie’s concept of wave-particle duality and is consistent with\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle. When Schrödinger equation is solved for the electron in a\nhydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy states the electron can occupy [and\nthe corresponding wave function(s) (ψ) (which in fact are the mathematical functions) of the\nelectron associated with each energy state]. These quantized energy states and corresponding\nwave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers (principal\nquantum number n, azimuthal quantum number l and magnetic quantum number m)\nl\narise as a natural consequence in the solution of the Schrödinger equation. The restrictions\non the values of these three quantum numbers also come naturally from this solution. The\nquantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom successfully predicts all aspects of the\nhydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the\nBohr model.\nAccording to the quantum mechanical model of the atom, the electron distribution of an\natom containing a number of electrons is divided into shells. The shells, in turn, are thought\nto consist of one or more subshells and subshells are assumed to be composed of one or\nmore orbitals, which the electrons occupy. While for hydrogen and hydrogen like systems\n(such as He+, Li2+ etc.) all the orbitals within a given shell have same energy, the energy of\nthe orbitals in a multi-electron atom depends upon the values of n and l: The lower the value\nof (n + l ) for an orbital, the lower is its energy.

Modern Periodic table arranges\nthe elements in the order of their atomic numbers in seven horizontal rows (periods) and\neighteen vertical columns (groups or families). Atomic numbers in a period are consecutive,\nwhereas in a group they increase in a pattern. Elements of the same group have similar\nvalence shell electronic configuration and, therefore, exhibit similar chemical properties.\nHowever, the elements of the same period have incrementally increasing number of electrons\nfrom left to right, and, therefore, have different valencies. Four types of elements can be\nrecognized in the periodic table on the basis of their electronic configurations. These are\ns-block, p-block, d-block and f-block elements. Hydrogen with one electron in the 1s orbital\noccupies a unique position in the periodic table. metals comprise more than seventy eight\nper cent of the known elements. non-metals, which are located at the top of the periodic\ntable, are less than twenty in number. Elements which lie at the border line between metals\nand non-metals (e.g., Si, Ge, As) are called metalloids or semi-metals. Metallic character\nincreases with increasing atomic number in a group whereas decreases from left to right\nin a period. The physical and chemical properties of elements vary periodically with their\natomic numbers.\nPeriodic trends are observed in atomic sizes, ionization enthalpies, electron gain\nenthalpies, electronegativity and valence. The atomic radii decrease while going from\nleft to right in a period and increase with atomic number in a group. Ionization enthalpies\ngenerally increase across a period and decrease down a group. Electronegativity also shows\na similar trend. Electron gain enthalpies, in general, become more negative across a period\nand less negative down a group. There is some periodicity in valence, for example, among\nrepresentative elements, the valence is either equal to the number of electrons in the\noutermost orbitals or eight minus this number. Chemical reactivity is highest at the two\nextremes of a period and is lowest in the centre. The reactivity on the left extreme of a period\nis because of the ease of electron loss (or low ionization enthalpy). Highly reactive elements\ndo not occur in nature in free state; they usually occur in the combined form. Oxides formed\nof the elements on the left are basic and of the elements on the right are acidic in nature.\nOxides of elements in the centre are amphoteric or neutral.\nUnit 3.indd 95 9/9/2022 4:36:15 PM\n96 chemistry\nEXErCisEs\n3.1 What is the basic theme of organisation in the periodic table?\n3.2 Which important property did Mendeleev use to classify the elements in his periodic\ntable and did he stick to that?\n3.3 What is the basic difference in approach between the Mendeleev’s Periodic Law and\nthe Modern Periodic Law?\n3.4 On the basis of quantum numbers, justify that the sixth period of the periodic table\nshould have 32 elements.\n3.5 In terms of period and group where would you locate the element with Z =114?\n3.6 Write the atomic number of the element present in the third period and seventeenth\ngroup of the periodic table.\n3.7 Which element do you think would have been named by\n(i) Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory\n(ii) Seaborg’s group?\n3.8 Why do elements in the same group have similar physical and chemical properties?\n3.9 What does atomic radius and ionic radius really mean to you?\n3.10 How do atomic radius vary in a period and in a group?

This gives the concept\nof electrovalency.\nThe first description of covalent bonding was provided by Lewis in terms of the sharing\nof electron pairs between atoms and he related the process to the attainment of noble gas\nconfigurations by reacting atoms as a result of sharing of electrons. The Lewis dot symbols\nshow the number of valence electrons of the atoms of a given element and Lewis dot structures\nshow pictorial representations of bonding in molecules.\nAn ionic compound is pictured as a three-dimensional aggregation of positive and negative\nions in an ordered arrangement called the crystal lattice. In a crystalline solid there is a\ncharge balance between the positive and negative ions. The crystal lattice is stabilized by\nthe enthalpy of lattice formation.\nWhile a single covalent bond is formed by sharing of an electron pair between two atoms,\nmultiple bonds result from the sharing of two or three electron pairs. Some bonded atoms\nhave additional pairs of electrons not involved in bonding. These are called lone-pairs of\nelectrons. A Lewis dot structure shows the arrangement of bonded pairs and lone pairs around\neach atom in a molecule. important parameters, associated with chemical bonds, like:\nbond length, bond angle, bond enthalpy, bond order and bond polarity have significant\neffect on the properties of compounds.\nA number of molecules and polyatomic ions cannot be described accurately by a single\nLewis structure and a number of descriptions (representations) based on the same skeletal\nstructure are written and these taken together represent the molecule or ion. This is a very\nimportant and extremely useful concept called resonance. The contributing structures\nor canonical forms taken together constitute the resonance hybrid which represents the\nmolecule or ion.\nReprint 2025-26\nUnit 4.indd 132 9/12/2022 9:36:18 AM\nChemiCal Bonding and moleCular StruCture 133\nThe VSEPR model used for predicting the geometrical shapes of molecules is based on\nthe assumption that electron pairs repel each other and, therefore, tend to remain as far\napart as possible. According to this model, molecular geometry is determined by repulsions\nbetween lone pairs and lone pairs; lone pairs and bonding pairs and bonding pairs and bonding\npairs. The order of these repulsions being : lp-lp > lp-bp > bp-bp\nThe valence bond (vB) approach to covalent bonding is basically concerned with the\nenergetics of covalent bond formation about which the Lewis and VSEPR models are silent.\nBasically the VB theory discusses bond formation in terms of overlap of orbitals. For example\nthe formation of the H molecule from two hydrogen atoms involves the overlap of the 1s\n2\norbitals of the two H atoms which are singly occupied. It is seen that the potential energy\nof the system gets lowered as the two H atoms come near to each other. At the equilibrium\ninter-nuclear distance (bond distance) the energy touches a minimum. Any attempt to bring\nthe nuclei still closer results in a sudden increase in energy and consequent destabilization\nof the molecule. Because of orbital overlap the electron density between the nuclei increases\nwhich helps in bringing them closer. It is however seen that the actual bond enthalpy and\nbond length values are not obtained by overlap alone and other variables have to be taken\ninto account.\nFor explaining the characteristic shapes of polyatomic molecules Pauling introduced the\nconcept of hybridisation of atomic orbitals. sp, sp2, sp3 hybridizations of atomic orbitals\nof Be, B, C, N and O are used to explain the formation and geometrical shapes of molecules\nlike BeCl , BCl , CH , NH and H O. They also explain the formation of multiple bonds in\n2 3 4 3 2\nmolecules like C H and C H .\n2 2 2 4\nThe molecular orbital (MO) theory describes bonding in terms of the combination and\narrangment of atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals that are associated with the molecule\nas a whole. The number of molecular orbitals are always equal to the number of atomic\norbitals from which they are formed. Bonding molecular orbitals increase electron density\nbetween the nuclei and are lower in energy than the individual atomic orbitals. Antibonding\nmolecular orbitals have a region of zero electron density between the nuclei and have more\nenergy than the individual atomic orbitals.\nThe electronic configuration of the molecules is written by filling electrons in the molecular\norbitals in the order of increasing energy levels. As in the case of atoms, the Pauli exclusion\nprinciple and Hund’s rule are applicable for the filling of molecular orbitals. Molecules are\nsaid to be stable if the number of elctrons in bonding molecular orbitals is greater than that\nin antibonding molecular orbitals.\nHydrogen bond is formed when a hydrogen atom finds itself between two highly\nelectronegative atoms such as F, O and N. It may be intermolecular (existing between two\nor more molecules of the same or different substances) or intramolecular (present within\nthe same molecule). Hydrogen bonds have a powerful effect on the structure and properties\nof many compounds.\nEXERCiSES\n4.1 Explain the formation of a chemical bond.\n4.2 Write Lewis dot symbols for atoms of the following elements : Mg, Na, B, O, N, Br.\n4.3 Write Lewis symbols for the following atoms and ions:\nS and S2–; Al and Al3+; H and H–\n4.4 Draw the Lewis structures for the following molecules and ions :\nH S, SiCl , BeF , CO2−, HCOOH\n2 4 2 3\n4.5 Define octet rule.

For these purposes, we divide\nthe universe into the system and the surroundings. Chemical or physical processes lead to evolution\nor absorption of heat (q), part of which may be converted into work (w). These quantities are related\nthrough the first law of thermodynamics via ∆U = q + w. ∆U, change in internal energy, depends\non initial and final states only and is a state function, whereas q and w depend on the path and\nare not the state functions. We follow sign conventions of q and w by giving the positive sign to\nthese quantities when these are added to the system. We can measure the transfer of heat from one\nsystem to another which causes the change in temperature. The magnitude of rise in temperature\ndepends on the heat capacity (C) of a substance. Therefore, heat absorbed or evolved is q = C∆T.\nWork can be measured by w = –p ∆V, in case of expansion of gases. Under reversible process, we\nex\ncan put p = pfor infinitesimal changes in the volume making w = – p dV.

Changes of phase such as melting, vaporization and\nsublimation usually occur at constant temperature and can be characterized by enthalpy changes\nwhich are always positive. Enthalpy of formation, combustion and other enthalpy changes can be\ncalculated using Hess’s law.

For isolated systems,\n∆U = 0. We define another state function, S, entropy for this purpose. entropy is a measure\nof disorder or randomness. For a spontaneous change, total entropy change is positive.\nTherefore, for an isolated system, ∆U = 0, ∆S > 0, so entropy change distinguishes a spontaneous\nchange, while energy change does not. Entropy changes can be measured by the equation\nq q\n∆S = rev for a reversible process. rev is independent of path.\nT T\nChemical reactions are generally carried at constant pressure, so we define another state function\ngibbs energy, G, which is related to entropy and enthalpy changes of the system by the equation:\n∆G = ∆H – T ∆S\nr r r\nFor a spontaneous change, ∆G < 0 and at equilibrium, ∆G = 0.\nsys sys\nStandard Gibbs energy change is related to equilibrium constant by\n∆G = – RT ln K.\nr\nK can be calculated from this equation, if we know ∆ G which can be found from\nr\n.

This can\nbe demonstrated by the use of radioactive isotopes. This is not feasible in a school laboratory.\nHowever this concept can be easily comprehended by performing the following activity. The activity\ncan be performed in a group of 5 or 6 students.\nTake two 100mL measuring cylinders (marked as 1 and 2) and two glass tubes each of\n30 cm length. Diameter of the tubes may be same or different in the range of 3-5mm. Fill\nnearly half of the measuring cylinder-1 with coloured water (for this purpose add a crystal\nof potassium permanganate to water) and keep second cylinder (number 2) empty.\nPut one tube in cylinder 1 and second in cylinder 2. Immerse one tube in cylinder 1,\nclose its upper tip with a finger and transfer the coloured water contained in its lower portion to\ncylinder 2. Using second tube, kept in 2nd cylinder, transfer the coloured water in a similar manner\nfrom cylinder 2 to cylinder 1. In this way keep on transferring coloured water using the two glass\ntubes from cylinder 1 to 2 and from 2 to 1 till you notice that the level of coloured water in both\nthe cylinders becomes constant.\nIf you continue intertransferring coloured solution between the cylinders, there will not be\nany further change in the levels of coloured water in two cylinders. If we take analogy of ‘level’ of\ncoloured water with ‘concentration’ of reactants and products in the two cylinders, we can say\nthe process of transfer, which continues even after the constancy of level, is indicative of dynamic\nnature of the process. If we repeat the experiment taking two tubes of different diameters we find\nthat at equilibrium the level of coloured water in two cylinders is different. How far diameters are\nresponsible for change in levels in two cylinders?

In\nThe Paradox of Fractional Oxidation Number\nSometimes, we come across with certain compounds in which the oxidation number of a particular\nelement in the compound is in fraction. Examples are:\nC O [where oxidation number of carbon is (4/3)],\n3 2\nBr O [where oxidation number of bromine is (16/3)]\n3 8\nand Na S O (where oxidation number of sulphur is 2.5).\n2 4 6\nWe know that the idea of fractional oxidation number is unconvincing to us, because electrons\nare never shared/transferred in fraction. Actually this fractional oxidation state is the average\noxidation state of the element under examination and the structural parameters reveal that the\nelement for whom fractional oxidation state is realised is present in different oxidation states.\nStructure of the species C O , Br O and S O2– reveal the following bonding situations:\n3 2 3 8 4 6\n+2 0 +2\nO = C = C*= C = O\nStructure of C O\n3 2\n(carbon suboxide)\nStructure of Br O (tribromooctaoxide) Structure of S O2– (tetrathionate ion)\n3 8 4 6\nThe element marked with asterisk in each species is exhibiting the different oxidation\nstate (oxidation number) from rest of the atoms of the same element in each of the species.\nThis reveals that in C O , two carbon atoms are present in +2 oxidation state each, whereas\n3 2\nthe third one is present in zero oxidation state and the average is 4/3. However, the realistic\npicture is +2 for two terminal carbons and zero for the middle carbon. Likewise in Br O , each\n3 8\nof the two terminal bromine atoms are present in +6 oxidation state and the middle bromine\nis present in +4 oxidation state. Once again the average, that is different from reality, is\n16/3. In the same fashion, in the species S O2–, each of the two extreme sulphurs exhibits oxidation\n4 6\nstate of +5 and the two middle sulphurs as zero. The average of four oxidation numbers of sulphurs\nof the S O 2– is 2.5, whereas the reality being + 5,0,0 and +5 oxidation number respectively for\n4 6\neach sulphur.\nWe may thus, in general, conclude that the idea of fractional oxidation state should be taken\nwith care and the reality is revealed by the structures only. Further, whenever we come across\nwith fractional oxidation state of any particular element in any species, we must understand that\nthis is the average oxidation number only. In reality (revealed by structures only), the element in\nthat particular species is present in more than one whole number oxidation states. Fe O , Mn O ,\n3 4 3 4\nPb O are some of the other examples of the compounds, which are mixed oxides, where we come\n3 4\nacross with fractional oxidation states of the metal atom. However, the oxidation states may be in\nfraction as in O+ and O– where it is +½ and –½ respectively.\n2 2\nReprint 2025-26\nUnit 7.indd 245 10/10/2022 10:37:04 AM\n246 chemistry\n(a) Oxidation Number Method: In writing\nProblem 7.7\nequations for oxidation-reduction reactions,\nWhy do the following reactions proceed just as for other reactions, the compositions and\ndifferently ? formulas must be known for the substances\nthat react and for the products that are\nPb O + 8HCl → 3PbCl + Cl + 4H O and\n3 4 2 2 2 formed.

Three tier conceptualisation viz, classical, electronic and oxidation\nnumber, which is usually available in the texts, has been presented in detail. Oxidation,\nreduction, oxidising agent (oxidant) and reducing agent (reductant) have been viewed\naccording to each conceptualisation. Oxidation numbers are assigned in accordance with a\nconsistent set of rules. Oxidation number and ion-electron method both are useful means in\nwriting equations for the redox reactions. Redox reactions are classified into four categories:\ncombination, decomposition displacement and disproportionation reactions. The concept of\nredox couple and electrode processes is introduced here. The redox reactions find wide\napplications in the study of electrode processes and cells.\nEXERCISES\n7.1 Assign oxidation number to the underlined elements in each of the following species:\n(a) NaH PO (b) NaHSO (c) H P O (d) K MnO\n2 4 4 4 2 7 2 4\n(e) CaO (f) NaBH (g) H S O (h) KAl(SO ) .12 H O\n2 4 2 2 7 42 2\n7.2 What are the oxidation number of the underlined elements in each of the following\nand how do you rationalise your results ?\n(a) KI (b) H S O (c) Fe O (d) CH CH OH (e) CH COOH\n3 2 4 6 3 4 3 2 3\n7.3 Justify that the following reactions are redox reactions:\n(a) CuO(s) + H (g) → Cu(s) + H O(g)\n2 2\n(b) Fe O (s) + 3CO(g) → 2Fe(s) + 3CO (g)\n2 3 2\n(c) 4BCl (g) + 3LiAlH (s) → 2B H (g) + 3LiCl(s) + 3 AlCl (s)\n3 4 2 6 3\n(d) 2K(s) + F (g) → 2K+F– (s)\n2\n(e) 4 NH (g) + 5 O (g) → 4NO(g) + 6H O(g)\n3 2 2\n7.4 Fluorine reacts with ice and results in the change:\nH O(s) + F (g) → HF(g) + HOF(g)\n2 2\nJustify that this reaction is a redox reaction.\n7.5 Calculate the oxidation number of sulphur, chromium and nitrogen in H SO , Cr O2–\n2 5 2 7\nand NO–.

The nature of the covalent bonding\nin organic compounds can be described in terms of orbitals hybridisation concept,\naccording to which carbon can have sp3, sp2 and sp hybridised orbitals. The sp3, sp2 and sp\nhybridised carbons are found in compounds like methane, ethene and ethyne respectively.\nThe tetrahedral shape of methane, planar shape of ethene and linear shape of ethyne can\nbe understood on the basis of this concept. A sp3 hybrid orbital can overlap with 1s orbital\nof hydrogen to give a carbon - hydrogen (C–H) single bond (sigma, σ bond). Overlap of a sp2\norbital of one carbon with sp2 orbital of another results in the formation of a carbon–carbon\nσ bond. The unhybridised p orbitals on two adjacent carbons can undergo lateral (side-\nby-side) overlap to give a pi (π) bond. Organic compounds can be represented by various\nstructural formulas. The three dimensional representation of organic compounds on paper\ncan be drawn by wedge and dash formula.\nOrganic compounds can be classified on the basis of their structure or the functional\ngroups they contain. A functional group is an atom or group of atoms bonded together in a\nunique fashion and which determines the physical and chemical properties of the compounds.\nThe naming of the organic compounds is carried out by following a set of rules laid down by\nthe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (iuPac). In IUPAC nomenclature,\nthe names are correlated with the structure in such a way that the reader can deduce the\nstructure from the name.\nOrganic reaction mechanism concepts are based on the structure of the substrate\nmolecule, fission of a covalent bond, the attacking reagents, the electron displacement effects\nand the conditions of the reaction. These organic reactions involve breaking and making\nof covalent bonds. A covalent bond may be cleaved in heterolytic or homolytic fashion.\nA heterolytic cleavage yields carbocations or carbanions, while a homolytic cleavage gives\nfree radicals as reactive intermediate. Reactions proceeding through heterolytic cleavage\ninvolve the complimentary pairs of reactive species. These are electron pair donor known as\nnucleophile and an electron pair acceptor known as electrophile. The inductive, resonance,\nelectromeric and hyperconjugation effects may help in the polarisation of a bond making\ncertain carbon atom or other atom positions as places of low or high electron densities.\nOrganic reactions can be broadly classified into following types; substitution, addition,\nelimination and rearrangement reactions.\nPurification, qualitative and quantitative analysis of organic compounds are carried out\nfor determining their structures. The methods of purification namely : sublimation, distillation\nand differential extraction are based on the difference in one or more physical properties.\nChromatography is a useful technique of separation, identification and purification of\ncompounds. It is classified into two categories : adsorption and partition chromatography.\nAdsorption chromatography is based on differential adsorption of various components of a\nmixture on an adsorbent. Partition chromatography involves continuous partitioning of the\ncomponents of a mixture between stationary and mobile phases. After getting the compound\nin a pure form, its qualitative analysis is carried out for detection of elements present in it.\nNitrogen, sulphur, halogens and phosphorus are detected by lassaigne’s test. Carbon and\nhydrogen are estimated by determining the amounts of carbon dioxide and water produced.\nNitrogen is estimated by dumas or Kjeldahl’s method and halogens by Carius method.\nSulphur and phosphorus are estimated by oxidising them to sulphuric and phosphoric acids\nrespectively. The percentage of oxygen is usually determined by difference between the total\npercentage (100) and the sum of percentages of all other elements present.\nReprint 2025-26\nUnit 8.indd 291 10/10/2022 10:37:39 AM\n292 chemistry\nExERCISES\n8.1 What are hybridisation states of each carbon atom in the following compounds ?\nCH =C=O, CH CH=CH , (CH ) CO, CH =CHCN, C H\n2 3 2 32 2 6 6\n8.2 Indicate the σ and π bonds in the following molecules :\nC H , C H , CH Cl , CH =C=CH , CH NO , HCONHCH\n6 6 6 12 2 2 2 2 3 2 3\n8.3 Write bond line formulas for : Isopropyl alcohol, 2,3-Dimethylbutanal, Heptan-4-one.\n8.4 Give the IUPAC names of the following compounds :\n(a) (b) (c)\n(d) (e) (f) Cl CHCH OH\n2 2\n8.5 Which of the following represents the correct IUPAC name for the compounds\nconcerned ?

He gave the dynamic structural formula to\nbenzene which forms the basis for its modern electronic structure. He described\nthe discovery of benzene structure later as:\nFRIEDRICH\n“I was sitting writing at my textbook,but the work did not progress; my thoughts\nAUGUST KEKULÉ\nwere elsewhere.

I spent the rest of the night working out the consequences of\nthe hypothesis.

Hydrocarbons are mainly\nobtained from coal and petroleum, which are the major sources of energy. Petrochemicals\nare the prominent starting materials used for the manufacture of a large number of\ncommercially important products. LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) and CNG (compressed\nnatural gas), the main sources of energy for domestic fuels and the automobile industry, are\nobtained from petroleum. Hydrocarbons are classified as open chain saturated (alkanes)\nand unsaturated (alkenes and alkynes), cyclic (alicyclic) and aromatic, according to their\nstructure.\nThe important reactions of alkanes are free radical substitution, combustion, oxidation\nand aromatization. Alkenes and alkynes undergo addition reactions, which are mainly\nelectrophilic additions. Aromatic hydrocarbons, despite having unsaturation, undergo\nmainly electrophilic substitution reactions. These undergo addition reactions only under\nspecial conditions.\nAlkanes show conformational isomerism due to free rotation along the C–C sigma\nbonds. Out of staggered and the eclipsed conformations of ethane, staggered conformation\nis more stable as hydrogen atoms are farthest apart. Alkenes exhibit geometrical\n(cis-trans) isomerism due to restricted rotation around the carbon–carbon double bond.\nbenzene and benzenoid compounds show aromatic character. Aromaticity, the\nproperty of being aromatic is possessed by compounds having specific electronic structure\ncharacterised by Hückel (4n+2)π electron rule. The nature of groups or substituents attached\nto benzene ring is responsible for activation or deactivation of the benzene ring towards\nfurther electrophilic substitution and also for orientation of the incoming group. Some of\nthe polynuclear hydrocarbons having fused benzene ring system have carcinogenic property.\nExErcisEs\n9.1 How do you account for the formation of ethane during chlorination of methane ?\n9.2 Write IUPAC names of the following compounds :\n(a) CH CH=C(CH ) (b) CH =CH-C≡C-CH\n3 32 2 3\n(c) (d) –CH –CH –CH=CH\n2 2 2\n(f) CH (CH ) CH (CH ) CH\n3 24 23 3\n(e) CH 2 –CH (CH 3 ) 2\n(g) CH – CH = CH – CH – CH = CH – CH – CH – CH = CH\n3 2 2 2\n|\nC H\n2 5\n9.3 For the following compounds, write structural formulas and IUPAC names for all\npossible isomers having the number of double or triple bond as indicated :\n(a) C H (one double bond) (b) C H (one triple bond)\n4 8 5 8\n9.4 Write IUPAC names of the products obtained by the ozonolysis of the following\ncompounds :\n(i) Pent-2-ene (ii) 3,4-Dimethylhept-3-ene\n(iii) 2-Ethylbut-1-ene (iv) 1-Phenylbut-1-ene\nReprint 2025-26\nUnit 9.indd 326 10/10/2022 10:38:01 AM\nHydrocarbons 327\n9.5 An alkene ‘A’ on ozonolysis gives a mixture of ethanal and pentan-3-one.\nWrite structure and IUPAC name of ‘A’.\n9.6 An alkene ‘A’ contains three C – C, eight C – H σ bonds and one C – C π\nbond. ‘A’ on ozonolysis gives two moles of an aldehyde of molar mass 44\nu.
